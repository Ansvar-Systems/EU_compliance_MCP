title: EU Regulations MCP Server
description: |
  The EUR-Lex alternative for the AI age. Query 37 EU regulations — from GDPR and AI Act to DORA, MiFID II, eIDAS, Medical Device Regulation, and more — directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

  Built by Ansvar Systems in Stockholm, Sweden. This MCP server makes EU regulations searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable.

longDescription: |
  ## Why This Exists

  EU compliance is scattered across EUR-Lex PDFs, official journals, and regulatory sites. Whether you're a developer implementing GDPR data rights, a product team navigating AI Act risk assessments, a compliance officer mapping ISO 27001 to DORA requirements, or a legal researcher comparing regulations — you shouldn't need a law degree and 47 browser tabs.

  ## What's Included

  - **37 EU Regulations** — GDPR, DORA, NIS2, AI Act, CRA, MiCA, eIDAS 2.0, MDR, IVDR, and 28 more
  - **2,311 Articles** — Full text from official EUR-Lex sources
  - **3,508 Recitals** — Legislative context and interpretation guidance
  - **1,145 Official Definitions** — Searchable terminology database
  - **686 Control Mappings** — ISO 27001:2022 (313) & NIST CSF 2.0 (373)
  - **305 Applicability Rules** — Industry-specific regulation applicability
  - **Daily EUR-Lex Sync** — Automated freshness monitoring

  ## Key Benefits

  - **Smart Context Management**: Search returns relevant snippets (not entire regulations)
  - **Token-Aware**: Article retrieval includes warnings for large content
  - **Cross-Regulation Comparison**: Compare requirements across frameworks instantly
  - **Pre-Built Database**: Zero setup, 15MB database ships with the package
  - **Hosted Option Available**: Use without installation via Azure-hosted endpoint

  ## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

  **THIS TOOL IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Regulation text is sourced verbatim from EUR-Lex and UNECE (official sources). However:
  - Control mappings are interpretive aids, not official guidance
  - Applicability rules are generalizations, not legal determinations
  - Always verify against official sources and consult qualified legal counsel
