## Data Quality Metrics

| Metric | Count | Coverage |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Regulations | 49 | 100% of targeted scope |
| Articles | 2,528 | Complete |
| Recitals | 3,869 | 45/49 regulations (92%) |
| Definitions | 1,226 | Complete |
| Control Mappings (ISO 27001) | 312 | Core cybersecurity regs |
| Control Mappings (NIST CSF) | 373 | Core cybersecurity regs |
| Applicability Rules | 323 | All 49 regulations |
| Database Size | 19MB | Optimized |

**Recital Coverage Note:** 4 regulations lack recitals:
- UN R155, UN R156 (UNECE format doesn't use EU-style recitals)
- PLD, CSDDD (recent directives, verification pending)

---

## Update Monitoring Architecture

### Automated Daily Checks
- **Source:** EUR-Lex Official Journal RSS + direct version comparison
- **Frequency:** Daily at 06:00 UTC
- **Method:** Puppeteer-based fetching (bypasses AWS WAF)
- **Notifications:** GitHub Issues, optional webhooks (Slack/Discord)

### Monitored Regulations
All 49 regulations tracked in `source_registry` table:
- CELEX ID mapping
- EUR-Lex version dates
- Last fetch timestamps
- Quality status (complete/review/incomplete)

### Auto-Update Capability
Manual trigger available for maintainers:
1. Re-ingest all regulations from EUR-Lex
2. Rebuild database
3. Bump version, create git tag
4. Trigger npm publish workflow

## Security Assessment

**Architecture Review:**
- ✅ Pre-built database eliminates runtime EUR-Lex dependencies
- ✅ Read-only database mode for end users
- ✅ Parameterized SQL queries prevent injection
- ✅ Puppeteer runs in CI/CD sandbox only
- ✅ GitHub Actions secrets properly configured
- ⚠️ Recommendation: Add HTML sanitization before database insert

**Supply Chain:**
- Database committed to git (version controlled)
- SHA-256 checksums in npm package
- GitHub Actions audit trail
- No external runtime dependencies beyond Node.js

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Completed)
- [x] Add EU Chips Act
- [x] Add Critical Raw Materials Act
- [x] Create applicability rules for new regulations
- [x] Verify DORA RTS/ITS monitoring

### Short-term (Q2 2026)
- [ ] Monitor for AI Act implementing acts
- [ ] Add HTML sanitization to ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Implement amendment tracking (optional)

### Long-term (Post-v1.0)
- [ ] National transposition module (community-driven)
- [ ] Cross-reference graph database
- [ ] Delegated acts systematic tracking
