OF MACHINERY OR RELATED PRODUCTS\n\nPART A\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions apply:\n\n(a)\n\n‘hazard’ means a potential source of injury or damage to health;\n\n(b)\n\n‘danger zone’ means any zone within and/or around machinery or a related product in which a person is subject to a risk to his or her health or safety;\n\n(c)\n\n‘exposed person’ means any person wholly or partially in a danger zone;\n\n(d)\n\n‘operator’ means the person or persons installing, operating, adjusting, maintaining, cleaning, repairing or moving machinery or a related product;\n\n(e)\n\n‘risk’ means a combination of the probability and the degree of an injury or damage to health that can arise in a hazardous situation;\n\n(f)\n\n‘guard’ means a part of machinery or a related product used specifically to provide protection by means of a physical barrier;\n\n(g)\n\n‘protective device’ means a device (other than a guard) which reduces the risk, either alone or in conjunction with a guard;\n\n(h)\n\n‘intended use’ means the use of machinery or a related product in accordance with the information provided in the instructions for use;\n\n(i)\n\n‘reasonably foreseeable misuse’ means the use of machinery or a related product in a way not intended in the instructions for use, but which may result from readily predictable human behaviour.\n\nPART B\n\nGeneral principles\n\n1.\n\nThe manufacturer of machinery or a related product shall ensure that a risk assessment is carried out in order to determine the essential health and safety requirements which apply to the machinery or related product. The machinery or related product shall then be designed and constructed to eliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, to minimise all relevant risks, taking into account the results of the risk assessment.\n\nBy the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction referred to in the first subparagraph, the manufacturer shall:\n\n(a)\n\ndetermine the limits of the machinery or related product, which include the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof;\n\n(b)\n\nidentify the hazards that may be generated by the machinery or related product and the associated hazardous situations;\n\n(c)\n\nestimate the risks, taking into account the severity of the possible injury or damage to health and the probability of its occurrence;\n\n(d)\n\nevaluate the risks, with a view to determining whether risk reduction is required, in accordance with the objective of this Regulation;\n\n(e)\n\neliminate the hazards or reduce the risks associated with these hazards by application of protective measures, in the order of priority established in section 1.1.2(b).\n\nThe risk assessment and risk reduction shall include hazards that might arise during the lifecycle of the machinery or related product that are foreseeable at the time of placing the machinery or related product on the market as an intended evolution of its fully or partially self-evolving behaviour or logic as a result of the machinery or related product designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy. The risk assessment and risk reduction shall include risks resulting from interactions between machinery in order to achieve the same end that are arranged and controlled so that they function as an integral whole, thus forming machinery as defined in Article 3, point 1, point (d).\n\n2.\n\nThe obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements only apply when the corresponding hazard exists for the machinery or related product in question when it is used under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer or in foreseeable abnormal situations. However, the principles of safety integration established in section 1.1.2 and the obligations concerning marking of machinery or related products referred to in section 1.7.3, and instructions for use referred to in section 1.7.4 apply in all cases.\n\n3.\n\nThe essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Annex are mandatory; however, taking into account the state of the art, it may not be possible to meet the objectives set by them. In that event, the machinery or related product shall, as far as possible, be designed and constructed with the purpose of approaching those objectives.\n\n4.\n\nThis Annex is organised into six chapters. The first chapter is of general scope and applicable to all machinery or related products. The other chapters refer to certain sorts of more specific hazards. Nevertheless, it is essential to examine the whole of this Annex in order to be sure of meeting all the relevant essential health and safety requirements. When machinery or a related product is being designed, the requirements of the first chapter and the requirements of one or more of the other chapters shall be taken into account, depending on the results of the risk assessment carried out in accordance with point 1 of these General Principles. Essential health and safety requirements for the protection of the environment are applicable only to the machinery or related products referred to in section 2.4.\n\n5.\n\nThese general principles shall apply to the risk assessment carried out by the manufacturer of partly completed machinery.\n\n1.   ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.1.   General remarks\n\n1.1.1.   Applicability\n\nThe obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements are applicable to partly completed machinery insofar as those requirements are relevant.\n\nThe relevant requirements in relation to partly completed machinery do not cover the requirements that can only be fulfilled at the time of the incorporation of the partly completed machinery. However, the principles of safety integration established in section 1.1.2 are applicable in all cases.\n\n1.1.2.   Principles of safety integration\n\n(a)\n\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed so that they are fit for their function, and can be operated, adjusted and maintained without putting persons at risk when these operations are carried out under the conditions foreseen but also taking into account any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The aim of protective measures shall be to eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable lifetime of the machinery or related product including the phases of transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping.\n\n(b)\n\nIn selecting the most appropriate methods, the manufacturer shall apply the following principles, in the order given:\n\n(i)\n\neliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, minimise risks (inherently safe machinery or related product design and construction);\n\n(ii)\n\ntake the necessary protective measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated;\n\n(iii)\n\ninform users of the residual risks due to any shortcomings of the protective measures adopted, indicate whether any particular training is required and specify any need to provide personal protective equipment.\n\n(c)\n\nWhen designing and constructing machinery or a related product and when drafting the instructions for use, the manufacturer shall envisage not only the intended use of the machinery or related product but also any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The machinery or related product shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent abnormal use if such use would engender a risk. Where appropriate, the instructions for use shall draw the user’s attention to ways – which experience has shown might occur – in which the machinery or related product should not be used.\n\n(d)\n\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed to take account of the constraints to which the operator is subject as a result of the necessary or foreseeable use of personal protective equipment.\n\n(e)\n\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed in such a way that it is possible for the user, where applicable, to test the safety functions. The machinery or related product shall be supplied with all the special equipment and accessories, and where appropriate, with the description of specific functional test procedures, essential to enable it to be tested, adjusted, maintained and used safely.\n\n1.1.3.   Materials and products\n\nThe materials used to construct machinery or related products, or products used or created during its use, shall not endanger the health and safety of persons.

Therefore, the conformity assessment of a safety component or a system with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be carried out by a third party, whether or not the safety component has been placed independently on the market or is part of a system embedded in machinery that is placed on the market. However, where machinery embeds a system of which the safety component has already been subject to third party conformity assessment when it was placed independently on the market, that machinery should not have to be re-certified by a third party solely on the basis of the embedding of that system."
