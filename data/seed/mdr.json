This Regulation also applies to clinical investigations concerning such medical devices and accessories conducted in the Union.\n\n2.   This Regulation shall also apply, as from the date of application of common specifications adopted pursuant to Article 9, to the groups of products without an intended medical purpose that are listed in Annex XVI, taking into account the state of the art, and in particular existing harmonised standards for analogous devices with a medical purpose, based on similar technology. The common specifications for each of the groups of products listed in Annex XVI shall address, at least, application of risk management as set out in Annex I for the group of products in question and, where necessary, clinical evaluation regarding safety.\n\nThe necessary common specifications shall be adopted by 26 May 2020. They shall apply as from six months after the date of their entry into force or from 26 May 2020, whichever is the latest.\n\nNotwithstanding Article 122, Member States' measures regarding the qualification of the products covered by Annex XVI as medical devices pursuant to Directive 93/42/EEC shall remain valid until the date of application, as referred to in the first subparagraph, of the relevant common specifications for that group of products.\n\nThis Regulation also applies to clinical investigations conducted in the Union concerning the products referred to in the first subparagraph.\n\n3.   Devices with both a medical and a non-medical intended purpose shall fulfil cumulatively the requirements applicable to devices with an intended medical purpose and those applicable to devices without an intended medical purpose.\n\n4.   For the purposes of this Regulation, medical devices, accessories for medical devices, and products listed in Annex XVI to which this Regulation applies pursuant to paragraph 2 shall hereinafter be referred to as ‘devices’.\n\n5.   Where justified on account of the similarity between a device with an intended medical purpose placed on the market and a product without an intended medical purpose in respect of their characteristics and risks, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 to amend the list in Annex XVI, by adding new groups of products, in order to protect the health and safety of users or other persons or other aspects of public health.\n\n6.   This Regulation does not apply to:\n\n(a)\n\nin vitro diagnostic medical devices covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/746;\n\n(b)\n\nmedicinal products as defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC. In deciding whether a product falls under Directive 2001/83/EC or under this Regulation, particular account shall be taken of the principal mode of action of the product;\n\n(c)\n\nadvanced therapy medicinal products covered by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007;\n\n(d)\n\nhuman blood, blood products, plasma or blood cells of human origin or devices which incorporate, when placed on the market or put into service, such blood products, plasma or cells, except for devices referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article;\n\n(e)\n\ncosmetic products covered by Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009;\n\n(f)\n\ntransplants, tissues or cells of animal origin, or their derivatives, or products containing or consisting of them; however this Regulation does apply to devices manufactured utilising tissues or cells of animal origin, or their derivatives, which are non-viable or are rendered non-viable;\n\n(g)\n\ntransplants, tissues or cells of human origin, or their derivatives, covered by Directive 2004/23/EC, or products containing or consisting of them; however this Regulation does apply to devices manufactured utilising derivatives of tissues or cells of human origin which are non-viable or are rendered non-viable;\n\n(h)\n\nproducts, other than those referred to in points (d), (f) and (g), that contain or consist of viable biological material or viable organisms, including living micro-organisms, bacteria, fungi or viruses in order to achieve or support the intended purpose of the product;\n\n(i)\n\nfood covered by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n\n7.   Any device which, when placed on the market or put into service, incorporates as an integral part an in vitro diagnostic medical device as defined in point 2 of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746, shall be governed by this Regulation. The requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 shall apply to the in vitro diagnostic medical device part of the device.\n\n8.   Any device which, when placed on the market or put into service, incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, would be considered to be a medicinal product as defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, including a medicinal product derived from human blood or human plasma as defined in point 10 of Article 1 of that Directive, and that has an action ancillary to that of the device, shall be assessed and authorised in accordance with this Regulation.\n\nHowever, if the action of that substance is principal and not ancillary to that of the device, the integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34), as applicable. In that case, the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation shall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part are concerned.\n\n9.   Any device which is intended to administer a medicinal product as defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC shall be governed by this Regulation, without prejudice to the provisions of that Directive and of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with regard to the medicinal product.\n\nHowever, if the device intended to administer a medicinal product and the medicinal product are placed on the market in such a way that they form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as applicable. In that case, the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation shall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part of the single integral product are concerned.\n\n10.   Any device which, when placed on the market or put into service, incorporates, as an integral part, non-viable tissues or cells of human origin or their derivatives that have an action ancillary to that of the device shall be assessed and authorised in accordance with this Regulation. In that case, the provisions for donation, procurement and testing laid down in Directive 2004/23/EC shall apply.\n\nHowever, if the action of those tissues or cells or their derivatives is principal and not ancillary to that of the device and the product is not governed by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, the product shall be governed by Directive 2004/23/EC. In that case, the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation shall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part are concerned.\n\n11.   This Regulation is specific Union legislation within the meaning of Article 2(3) of Directive 2014/30/EU.\n\n12.   Devices that are also machinery within the meaning of point (a) of the second paragraph of Article 2 of Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (35) shall, where a hazard relevant under that Directive exists, also meet the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex I to that Directive to the extent to which those requirements are more specific than the general safety and performance requirements set out in Chapter II of Annex I to this Regulation.\n\n13.   This Regulation shall not affect the application of Directive 2013/59/Euratom.\n\n14.   This Regulation shall not affect the right of a Member State to restrict the use of any specific type of device in relation to aspects not covered by this Regulation.\n\n15.   This Regulation shall not affect national law concerning the organisation, delivery or financing of health services and medical care, such as the requirement that certain devices may only be supplied on a medical prescription, the requirement that only certain health professionals or healthcare institutions may dispense or use certain devices or that their use be accompanied by specific professional counselling.\n\n16.   Nothing in this Regulation shall restrict the freedom of the press or the freedom of expression in the media in so far as those freedoms are guaranteed in the Union and in the Member States, in particular under Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.",

performance intended by their manufacturer and shall be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, they are suitable for their intended purpose. They shall be safe and effective and shall not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art.\n\n2.   The requirement in this Annex to reduce risks as far as possible means the reduction of risks as far as possible without adversely affecting the benefit-risk ratio.\n\n3.   Manufacturers shall establish, implement, document and maintain a risk management system.\n\nRisk management shall be understood as a continuous iterative process throughout the entire lifecycle of a device, requiring regular systematic updating. In carrying out risk management manufacturers shall:\n\n(a)\n\nestablish and document a risk management plan for each device;\n\n(b)\n\nidentify and analyse the known and foreseeable hazards associated with each device;\n\n(c)\n\nestimate and evaluate the risks associated with, and occurring during, the intended use and during reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n\n(d)\n\neliminate or control the risks referred to in point (c) in accordance with the requirements of Section 4;\n\n(e)\n\nevaluate the impact of information from the production phase and, in particular, from the post-market surveillance system, on hazards and the frequency of occurrence thereof, on estimates of their associated risks, as well as on the overall risk, benefit-risk ratio and risk acceptability; and\n\n(f)\n\nbased on the evaluation of the impact of the information referred to in point (e), if necessary amend control measures in line with the requirements of Section 4.\n\n4.   Risk control measures adopted by manufacturers for the design and manufacture of the devices shall conform to safety principles, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the art. To reduce risks, Manufacturers shall manage risks so that the residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk is judged acceptable. In selecting the most appropriate solutions, manufacturers shall, in the following order of priority:\n\n(a)\n\neliminate or reduce risks as far as possible through safe design and manufacture;\n\n(b)\n\nwhere appropriate, take adequate protection measures, including alarms if necessary, in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated; and\n\n(c)\n\nprovide information for safety (warnings/precautions/contra-indications) and, where appropriate, training to users.\n\nManufacturers shall inform users of any residual risks.\n\n5.   In eliminating or reducing risks related to use error, the manufacturer shall:\n\n(a)\n\nreduce as far as possible the risks related to the ergonomic features of the device and the environment in which the device is intended to be used (design for patient safety), and\n\n(b)\n\ngive consideration to the technical knowledge, experience, education, training and use environment, where applicable, and the medical and physical conditions of intended users (design for lay, professional, disabled or other users).\n\n6.   The characteristics and performance of a device shall not be adversely affected to such a degree that the health or safety of the patient or the user and, where applicable, of other persons are compromised during the lifetime of the device, as indicated by the manufacturer, when the device is subjected to the stresses which can occur during normal conditions of use and has been properly maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n7.   Devices shall be designed, manufactured and packaged in such a way that their characteristics and performance during their intended use are not adversely affected during transport and storage, for example, through fluctuations of temperature and humidity, taking account of the instructions and information provided by the manufacturer.\n\n8.   All known and foreseeable risks, and any undesirable side-effects, shall be minimised and be acceptable when weighed against the evaluated benefits to the patient and/or user arising from the achieved performance of the device during normal conditions of use.\n\n9.   For the devices referred to in Annex XVI, the general safety requirements set out in Sections 1 and 8 shall be understood to mean that the device, when used under the conditions and for the purposes intended, does not present a risk at all or presents a risk that is no more than the maximum acceptable risk related to the product's use which is consistent with a high level of protection for the safety and health of persons.\n\nREQUIREMENTS REGARDING DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE\n\n10.   Chemical, physical and biological properties\n\n10.1.   Devices shall be designed and manufactured in such a way as to ensure that the characteristics and performance requirements referred to in Chapter I are fulfilled.

technology used to automatically capture data. AIDC technologies include bar codes, smart cards, biometrics and RFID.\n\nBasic UDI-DI\n\nThe Basic UDI-DI is the primary identifier of a device model. It is the DI assigned at the level of the device unit of use. It is the main key for records in the UDI database and is referenced in relevant certificates and EU declarations of conformity.\n\nUnit of Use DI\n\nThe Unit of Use DI serves to associate the use of a device with a patient in instances in which a UDI is not labelled on the individual device at the level of its unit of use, for example in the event of several units of the same device being packaged together.\n\nConfigurable device\n\nA configurable device is a device that consists of several components which can be assembled by the manufacturer in multiple configurations. Those individual components may be devices in themselves.\n\nConfigurable devices include computed tomography (CT) systems, ultrasound systems, anaesthesia systems, physiological Monitoring systems, radiology information systems (RIS).\n\nConfiguration\n\nConfiguration is a combination of items of equipment, as specified by the manufacturer, that operate together as a device to achieve an intended purpose. The combination of items may be modified, adjusted or customized to meet specific needs.\n\nConfigurations include inter alia:\n\n—\n\ngantries, tubes, tables, consoles and other items of equipment that can be configured/combined to deliver an intended function in computed tomography.\n\n—\n\nventilators, breathing circuits, vaporizers combined to deliver an intended function in anaesthesia.\n\nUDI-DI\n\nThe UDI-DI is a unique numeric or alphanumeric code specific to a model of device and that is also used as the ‘access key’ to information stored in a UDI database.\n\nHuman Readable Interpretation (‘HRI’)\n\nHRI is a legible interpretation of the data characters encoded in the UDI carrier.\n\nPackaging levels\n\nPackaging levels means the various levels of device packaging that contain a defined quantity of devices, such as a carton or case.\n\nUDI-PI\n\nThe UDI-PI is a numeric or alphanumeric code that identifies the unit of device production.\n\nThe different types of UDI-PIs include serial number, lot number, software identification and manufacturing or expiry date or both types of date.\n\nRadio Frequency Identification RFID\n\nRFID is a technology that uses communication through the use of radio waves to exchange data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object, for the purpose of identification.\n\nShipping containers\n\nA shipping container is a container in relation to which traceability is controlled by a process specific to logistics systems.\n\nUnique Device Identifier (‘UDI’)\n\nThe UDI is a series of numeric or alphanumeric characters that is created through a globally accepted device identification and coding standard. It allows the unambiguous identification of a specific device on the market. The UDI is comprised of the UDI-DI and the UDI-PI.\n\nThe word ‘Unique’ does not imply serialisation of individual production units.\n\nUDI carrier\n\nThe UDI carrier is the means of conveying the UDI by using AIDC and, if applicable, its HRI.\n\nUDI carriers include, inter alia, ID/linear bar code, 2D/Matrix bar code, RFID.\n\n2.   General requirements\n\n2.1.   The affixing of the UDI is an additional requirement — it does not replace any other marking or labelling requirements laid down in Annex I to this Regulation.\n\n2.2.   The manufacturer shall assign and maintain unique UDIs for its devices.\n\n2.3.   Only the manufacturer may place the UDI on the device or its packaging.\n\n2.4.   Only coding standards provided by issuing entities designated by the Commission pursuant to Article 27(2) may be used.\n\n3.   The UDI\n\n3.1.   A UDI shall be assigned to the device itself or its packaging. Higher levels of packaging shall have their own UDI.\n\n3.2.   Shipping containers shall be exempted from the requirement in Section 3.1. By way of example, a UDI shall not be required on a logistics unit; where a healthcare provider orders multiple devices using the UDI or model number of individual devices and the manufacturer places those devices in a container for shipping or to protect the individually packaged devices, the container (logistics unit) shall not be subject to UDI requirements.\n\n3.3.   The UDI shall contain two parts: a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI.\n\n3.4.   The UDI-DI shall be unique at each level of device packaging.\n\n3.5.   If a lot number, serial number, software identification or expiry date appears on the label, it shall be part of the UDI-PI. If there is also a manufacturing date on the label, it does not need to be included in the UDI-PI. If there is only a manufacturing date on the label, this shall be used as the UDI-PI.\n\n3.6.   Each component that is considered to be a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI unless the components are part of a configurable device that is marked with its own UDI.\n\n3.7.   Systems and procedure packs as referred to in Article 22 shall be assigned and bear their own UDI.\n\n3.8.   The manufacturer shall assign the UDI to a device following the relevant coding standard.\n\n3.9.   A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a change that could lead to misidentification of the device and/or ambiguity in its traceability; in particular, any change of one of the following UDI database data elements shall require a new UDI-DI:\n\n(a)\n\nname or trade name,\n\n(b)\n\ndevice version or model,\n\n(c)\n\nlabelled as single use,\n\n(d)\n\npackaged sterile,\n\n(e)\n\nneed for sterilization before use,\n\n(f)\n\nquantity of devices provided in a package,\n\n(g)\n\ncritical warnings or contra-indications: e.g. containing latex or DEHP.\n\n3.10.   Manufacturers that repackage and/or relabel devices, with their own label shall retain a record of the original device manufacturer's UDI.\n\n4.   UDI carrier\n\n4.1.   The UDI carrier (AIDC and HRI representation of the UDI) shall be placed on the label or on the device itself and on all higher levels of device packaging. Higher levels do not include shipping containers.\n\n4.2.   In the event of there being significant space constraints on the unit of use packaging, the UDI carrier may be placed on the next higher packaging level.\n\n4.3.   For single-use devices of classes I and IIa packaged and labelled individually, the UDI carrier shall not be required to appear on the packaging but it shall appear on a higher level of packaging, e.g. a carton containing several individually packaged devices. However, when the healthcare provider is not expected to have access, in cases such as in home healthcare settings, to the higher level of device packaging, the UDI shall be placed on the packaging of the individual device.\n\n4.4.   For devices exclusively intended for retail point of sale the UDI-PIs in AIDC shall not be required to appear on the point of sale packaging.\n\n4.5.   When AIDC carriers other than the UDI carrier are part of the product labelling, the UDI carrier shall be readily identifiable.\n\n4.6.   If linear bar codes are used, the UDI-DI and UDI-PI may be concatenated or non-concatenated in two or more bar codes. All parts and elements of the linear bar code shall be distinguishable and identifiable.\n\n4.7.   If there are significant constraints limiting the use of both AIDC and HRI on the label, only the AIDC format shall be required to appear on the label. For devices intended to be used outside healthcare facilities, such as devices for home care, the HRI shall however appear on the label even if this results in there being no space for the AIDC.\n\n4.8.   The HRI format shall follow the rules of the UDI code-issuing entity.\n\n4.9.   If the manufacturer is using RFID technology, a linear or 2D bar code in line with the standard provided by the issuing entities shall also be provided on the label.\n\n4.10.   Devices that are reusable shall bear a UDI carrier on the device itself. The UDI carrier for reusable devices that require cleaning, disinfection, sterilisation or refurbishing between patient uses shall be permanent and readable after each process performed to make the device ready for the subsequent use throughout the intended lifetime of the device. The requirement of this Section shall not apply to devices in the following circumstances:\n\n(a)\n\nany type of direct marking would interfere with the safety or performance of the device;\n\n(b)\n\nthe device cannot be directly marked because it is not technologically feasible.\n\n4.11.   The UDI carrier shall be readable during normal use and throughout the intended lifetime of the device.\n\n4.12.   If the UDI carrier is readily readable or, in the case of AIDC, scannable, through the device's packaging, the placing of the UDI carrier on the packaging shall not be required.\n\n4.13.   In the case of single finished devices made up of multiple parts that must be assembled before their first use, it shall be sufficient to place the UDI carrier on only one part of each device.\n\n4.14.   The UDI carrier shall be placed in a manner such that the AIDC can be accessed during normal operation or storage.\n\n4.15.   Bar code carriers that include both a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI may also include essential data for the device to operate or other data.\n\n5.   General principles of the UDI database\n\n5.1.   The UDI database shall support the use of all core UDI database data elements referred to in Part B of this Annex.\n\n5.2.   Manufacturers shall be responsible for the initial submission and updates of the identifying information and other device data elements in the UDI database.\n\n5.3.   Appropriate methods/procedures for validation of the data provided shall be implemented.\n\n5.4.   Manufacturers shall periodically verify the correctness of all of the data relevant to devices they have placed on the market, except for devices that are no longer available on the market.\n\n5.5.   The presence of the device UDI-DI in the UDI database shall not be assumed to mean that the device is in conformity with this Regulation.\n\n5.6.   The database shall allow for the linking of all the packaging levels of the device.\n\n5.7.   The data for new UDI-DIs shall be available at the time the device is placed on the market.\n\n5.8.   Manufacturers shall update the relevant UDI database record within 30 days of a change being made to an element, which does not require a new UDI-DI.\n\n5.9.   Internationally-accepted standards for data submission and updates shall, wherever possible, be used by the UDI database.\n\n5.10.   The user interface of the UDI database shall be available in all official languages of the Union. The use of free-text fields shall, however, be minimized in order to reduce translations.\n\n5.11.   Data relating to devices that are no longer available on the market shall be retained in the UDI database.\n\n6.   Rules for specific device types\n\n6.1.   Implantable devices:\n\n6.1.1.\n\nImplantable devices shall, at their lowest level of packaging (‘unit packs’), be identified, or marked using AIDC, with a UDI (UDI-DI + UDI-PI);\n\n6.1.2.\n\nThe UDI-PI shall have at least the following characteristics:\n\n(a)\n\nthe serial number for active implantable devices,\n\n(b)\n\nthe serial number or lot number for other implantable devices.\n\n6.1.3.\n\nThe UDI of the implantable device shall be identifiable prior to implantation.\n\n6.2.   Reusable devices requiring cleaning, disinfection, sterilisation or refurbishing between uses\n\n6.2.1.   The UDI of such devices shall be placed on the device and be readable after each procedure to make the device ready for the next use.\n\n6.2.2.   The UDI-PI characteristics such as the lot or serial number shall be defined by the manufacturer.\n\n6.3.   Systems and procedure packs as referred to in Article 22\n\n6.3.1.   The natural or legal person referred to in Article 22 shall be responsible for identifying the system or procedure pack with a UDI including both UDI-DI and UDI-PI.\n\n6.3.2.   Device contents of system or procedure packs shall bear a UDI carrier on their packaging or on the device itself.\n\nExemptions:\n\n(a)\n\nindividual single-use disposable devices, the uses of which are generally known to the persons by whom they are intended to be used, which are contained within a system or procedure pack, and which are not intended for individual use outside the context of the system or procedure pack, shall not be required to bear their own UDI carrier;\n\n(b)\n\ndevices that are exempted from bearing a UDI carrier on the relevant level of packaging shall not be required to bear a UDI carrier when included within a system or procedure pack.\n\n6.3.3.   Placement of the UDI carrier on systems or procedure packs\n\n(a)\n\nThe system or procedure pack UDI carrier shall as a general rule be affixed to the outside of the packaging.\n\n(b)\n\nThe UDI carrier shall be readable, or, in the case of AIDC, scannable, whether placed on the outside of the packaging of the system or procedure pack or inside transparent packaging.\n\n6.4.   Configurable devices:\n\n6.4.1.   A UDI shall be assigned to the configurable device in its entirety and shall be called the configurable device UDI.\n\n6.4.2.   The configurable device UDI-DI shall be assigned to groups of configurations, not per configuration within the group. A group of configurations is defined as the collection of possible configurations for a given device as described in the technical documentation.\n\n6.4.3.   A configurable device UDI-PI shall be assigned to each individual configurable device.\n\n6.4.4.   The carrier of the configurable device UDI shall be placed on the assembly that is most unlikely to be exchanged during the lifetime of the system and shall be identified as the configurable device UDI.\n\n6.4.5.   Each component that is considered a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI.\n\n6.5.   Device Software\n\n6.5.1.   UDI assignment Criteria\n\nThe UDI shall be assigned at the system level of the software. Only software which is commercially available on its own and software which constitutes a device in itself shall be subject to that requirement.\n\nThe software identification shall be considered to be the manufacturing control mechanism and shall be displayed in the UDI-PI.\n\n6.5.2.   A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a modification that changes:\n\n(a)\n\nthe original performance;\n\n(b)\n\nthe safety or the intended use of the software;\n\n(c)\n\ninterpretation of data.\n\nSuch modifications include new or modified algorithms, database structures, operating platform, architecture or new user interfaces or new channels for interoperability.\n\n6.5.3.   Minor software revisions shall require a new UDI-PI and not a new UDI-DI.\n\nMinor software revisions are generally associated with bug fixes, usability enhancements that are not for safety purposes, security patches or operating efficiency.\n\nMinor software revisions shall be identified by a manufacturer-specific form of identification.\n\n6.5.4.   UDI placement criteria for software\n\n(a)\n\nwhere the software is delivered on a physical medium, e.g. CD or DVD, each packaging level shall bear the human readable and AIDC representation of the complete UDI. The UDI that is applied to the physical medium containing the software and its packaging shall be identical to the UDI assigned to the system level software;\n\n(b)\n\nthe UDI shall be provided on a readily accessible screen for the user in an easily-readable plain-text format, such as an ‘about’ file, or included on the start-up screen;\n\n(c)\n\nsoftware lacking a user interface such as middleware for image conversion, shall be capable of transmitting the UDI through an application programming interface (API);\n\n(d)\n\nonly the human readable portion of the UDI shall be required in electronic displays of the software. The marking of UDI using AIDC shall not be required in the electronic displays, such as ‘about’ menu, splash screen etc.;\n\n(e)\n\nthe human readable format of the UDI for the software shall include the Application Identifiers (AI) for the standard used by the issuing entities, so as to assist the user in identifying the UDI and determining which standard is being used to create the UDI.\n\nANNEX VII\n\nREQUIREMENTS TO BE MET BY NOTIFIED BODIES\n\n1.   ORGANISATIONAL AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.1.   Legal status and organisational structure\n\n1.1.1.   Each notified body shall be established under the national law of a Member State, or under the law of a third country with which the Union has concluded an agreement in this respect.
