Such divergent measures and approaches would continue to cause significant distortions of competition because of significant differences in disclosure standards. In addition, the parallel development of market‐based practices that are based on commercially‐driven priorities that produce divergent results currently causes further market fragmentation and might even further exacerbate inefficiencies in the functioning of the internal market in the future. Divergent disclosure standards and market‐based practices make it very difficult to compare different financial products, create an uneven playing field for such products and for distribution channels, and erect additional barriers within the internal market. Such divergences could also be confusing for end investors and could distort their investment decisions. In ensuring compliance with the Paris Agreement, there is a risk that Member States adopt divergent national measures which could create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market and be detrimental to financial market participants and financial advisers. Furthermore, the lack of harmonised rules relating to transparency makes it difficult for end investors to effectively compare different financial products in different Member States with respect to their environmental, social and governance risks and sustainable investment objectives. It is therefore necessary to address existing obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and to enhance the comparability of financial products in order to avoid likely future obstacles."

This Regulation seeks to achieve more transparency regarding how financial market participants and financial advisers integrate sustainability risks into their investment decisions and investment or insurance advice. Where the sustainability risk assessment leads to the conclusion that there are no sustainability risks deemed to be relevant to the financial product, the reasons therefor should be explained. Where the assessment leads to the conclusion that those risks are relevant, the extent to which those sustainability risks might impact the performance of the financial product should be disclosed either in qualitative or quantitative terms. The sustainability risk assessments and related pre‐contractual disclosures by financial market participants should feed into pre‐contractual disclosures by financial advisers. Financial advisers should disclose how they take sustainability risks into account in the selection process of the financial product that is presented to the end investors before providing the advice, regardless of the sustainability preferences of the end investors. This should be without prejudice to the application of provisions of national law transposing Directives 2014/65/EU and (EU) 2016/97, in particular the obligations on financial market participants and financial advisers as regards product governance, assessments of suitability and appropriateness, and the demands‐and‐needs test."

The information on such procedures might describe how financial market participants discharge their sustainability‐related stewardship responsibilities or other shareholder engagements. Financial market participants should include on their websites information on those procedures and descriptions of the principal adverse impacts. In that respect, the Joint Committee of the European Banking Authority established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) (ESMA) (the ‘Joint Committee’), and financial market participants and financial advisers should consider the due diligence guidance for responsible business conduct developed by the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations‐supported Principles for Responsible Investment."

Therefore, for the purposes of pre‐contractual disclosures and disclosures in periodical reports, it is necessary to distinguish between the requirements for financial products which promote environmental or social characteristics and those for financial products which have as an objective a positive impact on the environment and society. As a consequence, as regards the financial products with environmental or social characteristics, financial market participants should disclose whether and how the designated index, sustainability index or mainstream index, is aligned with those characteristics and where no benchmark is used, information on how the sustainability characteristics of the financial products are met. As regards financial products which have as an objective a positive impact on the environment and society, financial market participants should disclose which sustainable benchmark they use to measure the sustainable performance and where no benchmark is used, explain how the sustainable objective is met. Those disclosures by means of periodic reports should be carried out annually."

It is, however, appropriate to achieve more transparency, in qualitative or quantitative terms, on the remuneration policies of financial market participants and financial advisers, with respect to their investment or insurance advice, that promote sound and effective risk management with respect to sustainability risks whereas the structure of remuneration does not encourage excessive risk‐taking with respect to sustainability risks and is linked to risk‐adjusted performance."

Therefore, it is appropriate to set out more specific and standardised disclosure requirements with regard to such investments. For instance, the overall sustainability‐related impact of financial products should be reported regularly by means of indicators relevant for measuring the chosen sustainable investment objective. Where an appropriate index has been designated as a reference benchmark, that information should also be provided for the designated index as well as for a broad market index to allow for comparison.
