Information gathered from that register is essential for the financial entities’ internal ICT risk management, for the effective supervision of the financial entities by their competent authorities, and for the establishment and conduct of oversight of the critical ICT third-party providers by the Lead Overseer. Furthermore, that information is essential for the annual process to designate critical ICT third-party service providers by the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority (collectively ‘European Supervisory Authorities’ (ESAs))."

To reduce administrative costs of groups, groups should have the possibility to develop a single register of information at entity, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels in relation to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers to all the financial entities that are part of that group. In such cases, the single register of information should allow each financial entity to comply with its obligation to maintain and update the register of information at entity and sub-consolidated level, where applicable, including its reporting to its competent authority."

That risk assessment should take into account the criticality or importance of the service, process or function of the financial entity and the potential impact on the continuity and availability of financial services and activities, at entity level and at group level."

      "text": "Certain sector-specific Union financial services legislation contains requirements on outsourcing. Those requirements have been further developed in guidelines issued by the ESAs. Under those guidelines, some financial entities are expected to record specific information on their outsourcing arrangements, in some cases also in the form of registers, as part of their outsourcing risk management. In recent years, several national competent authorities and the ECB have collected information included in such registers as part of their supervision of financial entity compliance with the outsourcing requirements. Based on the lessons learned from the different data collection exercises of outsourcing registers performed in the recent years by the ESAs and competent authorities, the standard templates should be designed in a technology-neutral manner with open tables, which have a predefined number of columns and an indefinite number of rows. In addition, the standard templates should be linked to one another by using different specific keys forming a relational structure between those templates."

      "text": "To receive ICT services from an ICT third-party service provider, including ICT intra-group service providers, financial entities conclude a written contract with the ICT third-party service provider. In case of groups, ICT intra-group service providers may conclude a contract with ICT third-party providers that are external to the group to provide ICT services to one or more financial entities of the group. To capture the full ICT service supply chain, financial entities maintaining the register of information should report both information on the contractual arrangement with their ICT intra-group service provider and information on the arrangement stipulated by the ICT intra-group service provider and the ICT third-party providers that are external to the group as subcontractors. Therefore, the register of information should include a specific template enabling the reconciliation between the intra-group contracts and the contracts with ICT third-party service providers that are external to the group."

Financial entities should assess the associated risks, including ICT third-party concentration risks with regard to the ICT third-party service providers supporting a critical or important function or material parts thereof, considering a risk-based approach and the principle of proportionality. To enable that assessment, financial entities should be required to record in the register of information only those subcontractors that effectively underpin ICT services supporting critical or important functions or material parts thereof, including all the subcontractors providing ICT services whose disruption would impair the security or the continuity of the service provision. When identifying those subcontractors, financial entities should consider business and ICT service continuity and ICT security aspects."

Therefore, where an entity is acting on behalf of a financial entity for all the activities of the financial entity (including the ICT services), the direct ICT third-party service providers to that entity should be recorded in the relevant templates of the register of information of the financial entity.

Concerning legal persons, the LEI and EUID are recognised international and European identifiers ensuring the consistent, unique and robust identification of companies. Consequently, either of these two identifiers should be used for the identification of the ICT third-party service providers established in the Union for the purposes of the application of that Regulation and should be considered as information that is common to all contractual arrangements, whereas the ICT third-party service providers established in third-countries should be identified with LEI only. The templates used for the register of information about the ICT third-party service providers should require information on either of these two identifiers for ICT service providers that are legal persons, while allowing natural persons acting in the capacity of ICT service providers to use alternative identification codes."
