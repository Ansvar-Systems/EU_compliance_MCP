The calculation and verification rules shall identify at least the three most relevant environmental impact categories accounting for the majority of the overall environmental footprint. One of the environmental impact categories shall be greenhouse gas emissions. The footprint declaration shall be limited to those environmental impact categories.\n\n2.   The Commission shall by 24 November 2026 submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council setting out which critical raw materials are to be prioritised for assessing whether the obligation to declare the environmental footprint of a critical raw material is necessary and proportionate.\n\nFor the critical raw materials that the Commission has identified as a priority, the Commission shall present the conclusions of the assessment of necessity and proportionality for the purposes of paragraph 3 by 12 months from submission of the report referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.\n\n3.   The Commission shall adopt calculation and verification rules for a specific critical raw material if it has concluded, having considered the various relevant environmental impact categories, that the critical raw material concerned has a significant environmental footprint and that therefore an obligation to declare the environmental footprint of that critical raw material regarding the environmental impact categories referred to in paragraph 1, when placing it on the market, is necessary and proportionate to contribute to the Union’s climate and environmental objectives by facilitating the supply of critical raw materials with lower environmental footprint.\n\n4.   When considering whether the obligation provided for in paragraph 6 of this Article is necessary, the Commission shall take into account:\n\n(a)\n\nwhether and how as well as how effectively the Union’s climate and environmental objectives are already being achieved through other Union legal acts applicable to the critical raw material concerned;\n\n(b)\n\nthe existence and uptake of relevant international standards and guidelines, or the prospects of agreeing on such standards at international level, as well as sustainable practices on the market, including the voluntary schemes recognised pursuant to Article 30(2);\n\n(c)\n\nthe effectiveness of Strategic Partnerships, Strategic Projects, trade agreements and other international instruments and outreach conducted by the Union in achieving the Union’s climate and environmental objectives;\n\n(d)\n\nthe associated economic costs and administrative burden for economic operators.\n\n5.   The Commission shall conduct a prior assessment of impacts in order to decide whether to adopt a delegated act pursuant to paragraph 1. That assessment shall:\n\n(a)\n\nbe based, inter alia, on a consultation of:\n\n(i)\n\nall relevant stakeholders, such as industry including downstream industry, SMEs, and, where relevant, the craft industry, social partners, traders, retailers, importers, organisations promoting human health and environmental protection, consumer organisations and academia;\n\n(ii)\n\nthird countries, or OCTs, whose trade with the Union may be significantly affected by this obligation;\n\n(iii)\n\nthe Board;\n\n(iv)\n\nUnion agencies with competence in the field of environmental protection, as appropriate;\n\n(b)\n\nensure that any such measure is not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade and is no more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve the Union’s climate and environmental objectives, having regard to the ability of third-country suppliers to comply with such a declaration such that aggregate trade flows and critical raw materials costs are not disproportionately affected;\n\n(c)\n\nassess whether similar obligations under Union law have produced the intended effects and significantly contributed to the achievement of the Union’s environmental targets;\n\n(d)\n\nassess whether the measure would contribute to achieving the Union’s climate and environmental objectives without disproportionately impacting the ability of Union industry to source the critical raw material concerned.\n\n6.   Any natural or legal person that places on the market critical raw materials, including processed and recycled, for which the Commission has adopted calculation and verification rules pursuant to paragraph 1 shall make available an environmental footprint declaration.\n\nThe requirement set out in the first subparagraph shall apply to each individual critical raw material type placed on the market and shall not apply to critical raw materials included in intermediate or final products.\n\n7.   The environmental footprint declaration referred to in paragraph 6 shall contain the following information:\n\n(a)\n\nthe name, registered trade name or registered trademark and the postal address of the natural or legal person responsible and electronic means of communication where they can be contacted;\n\n(b)\n\ninformation about the critical raw material type for which the declaration applies;\n\n(c)\n\ninformation about the country and region where the critical raw material was extracted, processed, refined and recycled, as applicable;\n\n(d)\n\nthe environmental footprint of the critical raw material, calculated in accordance with the applicable verification and calculation rules adopted pursuant to paragraph 1;\n\n(e)\n\nthe environmental footprint performance class that the critical raw material corresponds to, established in accordance with the applicable delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 8;\n\n(f)\n\na web link providing access to a public version of the study supporting the environmental footprint declaration results.\n\n8.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 38 to supplement this Regulation by establishing environmental footprint performance classes within a reasonable timeframe for critical raw materials for which calculation and verification rules have been adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, in accordance with Annex V.\n\n9.   The Commission shall, when setting calculation rules for the environmental footprint of intermediate and final products containing critical raw materials, require, where possible, the use of the environmental footprint calculation rules referred to in this Article.\n\n10.   The environmental footprint declaration shall be made available on a free-access website and shall be easily understandable.\n\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing the format for the environmental footprint declaration referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(3).\n\n11.   When offering critical raw materials for sale, including in the case of distance selling, or displaying them in the course of a commercial activity, natural and legal persons placing on the market critical raw materials shall ensure that their customers have access to the environmental footprint declaration before being bound by a sales contract.\n\nNatural and legal persons placing on the market critical raw materials shall not provide or display labels, marks, symbols or inscriptions that are likely to mislead or confuse customers with respect to the information included in the environmental footprint declaration.\n\nSECTION 3\n\nFree movement, conformity and market surveillance"

footprint of specific critical raw materials shall build on the essential elements included in this Annex, taking into account scientifically sound assessment methods and relevant international standards in the area of life-cycle assessment.\n\nThe calculation of the environmental footprint of a critical raw material shall be based on the bill of material, the energy, production methods, and auxiliary materials used at the facilities involved on the production of critical raw material.\n\nWhen establishing calculation rules for the environmental footprint of specific critical raw

environmental footprint calculations, as it is not under the direct influence of the economic operator responsible. Other processes may be excluded where their contribution to the environmental footprint of a specific critical raw material is insignificant.\n\nPart V\n\nImpact categories\n\nThe calculation rules shall specify the impact categories that need to be included in the environmental footprint calculation. The choice shall be based on the hotspot analysis carried out in line with scientifically sound methodologies developed at international level and taking into account the:\n\n(a)\n\nrelative importance of different impacts, including their relative importance for meeting Union climate and environmental objectives;\n\n(b)\n\nneeds of downstream undertakings wishing to communicate on the environmental footprint of the critical raw materials they use.\n\nPart VI\n\nUse of company-specific and secondary datasets\n\nThe calculation rules shall specify the use of company specific or secondary datasets for all relevant processes and materials. If calculation rules allow for the choice between a company specific dataset and a secondary dataset, the Commission shall consider incentivising the use the company specific dataset.\n\nThe use of company-specific data shall be required at least for the processes under the direct influence of the operator responsible and have the largest contribution to the relevant impact categories.\n\nThe company specific activity data shall be used in combination with the relevant environmental footprint compliant secondary datasets. The calculation rules shall specify whether sampling is allowed, in line with the criteria set out in scientifically sound methodologies developed at international level.\n\nA change in the bill of materials or energy mix used to produce a critical raw material type requires a new calculation of the environmental footprint.\n\nWhen setting calculation rules, including for the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the electricity used for the production of critical raw materials, the Commission shall ensure consistency and alignment with other relevant Union law, unless it is justified not to do so.\n\nThe calculation rules to be elaborated via a delegated act shall include detailed modelling of the following lifecycle stages:\n\n(a)\n\nprimary raw material extraction, concentration and refining stage;\n\n(b)\n\nsecondary raw material acquisition and processing stage.\n\nPart VII\n\nImpact assessment methods\n\nThe environmental footprint shall be calculated using scientifically sound impact assessment methods which take into account developments on the international level for relevant impact categories related to climate change, water, air, soil, resources, land use and toxicity.\n\nThe results shall be provided as characterised results, without normalisation and weighting.\n\nPart VIII\n\nEnvironmental footprint performance classes\n\nDepending on the distribution of the values of the environmental footprint declarations placed on the internal market, a meaningful number of classes of performance shall be identified, with category A being the best class with the lowest life-cycle impact, to allow for market differentiation. The identification of the threshold for each class of performance, as well as their width, shall be based on the distribution of performances of the relevant critical raw materials placed on the market in the previous three years, the expected technological improvements, and other technical factors to be identified.\n\nThe Commission shall review the number of performance classes and the thresholds between them every three years in order to keep them representative of the market reality and its expected development.\n\nPart IX\n\nConformity assessment\n\nThe calculation and verification rules shall specify the applicable conformity assessment procedure from among the modules set out in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC, with the adaptations necessary in view of the material concerned.\n\nWhen specifying the applicable conformity assessment procedure, the Commission shall consider the following criteria:\n\n(a)\n\nwhether the module concerned is appropriate to the type of material and proportionate to the public interest pursued;\n\n(b)\n\nthe nature of the risks entailed by the product and the extent to which conformity assessment corresponds to the type and degree of risk;\n\n(c)\n\nwhere third party involvement is mandatory, the need for the manufacturer to have a choice between quality assurance and product certification modules set out in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC.\n\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1252/oj\n\nISSN 1977-0677 (electronic edition)\n\n////////////////////////$(document).ready(function(){generateTOC(true,'', 'Top','false');scrollToCurrentUrlAnchor();});"

Given the key role of many such critical raw materials in realising the green and digital transitions and in light of their use for defence and aerospace applications demand is likely to increase exponentially in the coming decades.

Critical raw materials are often extracted in specific countries or regions, depending on the geographical distribution of relevant reserves, transported for further processing elsewhere and then sold across the internal market for use in relevant products. At the processing stage, critical raw materials are often imported and exported several times within the internal market before use in a final application. Similarly, the end-of-life recycling of relevant products with a view to the recovery of critical raw materials can take place in a country or a region different from that where the waste is collected, and the resulting secondary raw materials are likely to be re-exported for further processing and use. Moreover, critical raw materials are needed at the beginning of many industrial value chains and are often indispensable inputs for a wide set of strategic sectors including renewable energy, the digital industry, and the aerospace and defence sectors. They therefore play an essential role in underpinning economic activities in the internal market, and supply disruptions could have a significant cross-border impact between Member States."

Such benchmarks should help to guide efforts to strengthen Union capacities along all stages of the strategic raw materials value chain, including extraction, processing and recycling, and to increase the diversification of external supplies of strategic raw materials. The aim should be to increase capacities for each strategic raw material at each stage of the value chain, while aiming to achieve overall capacity benchmarks at Union level for extraction, processing and recycling of strategic raw materials. First, the Union should increase the use of its own geological resources of strategic raw materials and build up capacity to allow it to extract the raw materials needed to produce at least 10 % of the Union’s consumption of strategic raw materials. Taking into account the fact that extraction capacity is highly dependent on the availability of Union geological resources, meeting that benchmark is dependent on such availability. Second, in order to build a full value chain and prevent any bottlenecks at intermediate stages, the Union processing capacity should also be increased and the Union should be able to produce at least 40 % of its annual consumption of strategic raw materials. Third, it is expected that in the coming decades a growing share of the Union’s consumption of strategic raw materials can be covered by secondary raw materials, which would improve both the security and the sustainability of the Union’s raw materials supply. Union recycling capacity should therefore be able to produce at least 25 % of the Union’s annual consumption of strategic raw materials and the Union should be able to recycle significantly increasing amounts of each strategic raw material from waste. For waste streams and strategic raw materials for which sufficient information is available to estimate the Union recycling capacity as a share of the strategic raw materials contained in those waste streams, an additional waste-based benchmark should be set. Accompanying efforts to improve resource efficiency through research and innovation, substitution, awareness-raising and other relevant measures will also facilitate meeting those benchmarks. Those benchmarks refer to the 2030 time horizon, in alignment with the Union’s climate and energy targets set in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and the digital targets set in Decision (EU) 2022/2481 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), which they underpin. Furthermore, quality jobs, including skills development and job-to-job transitions, will address risks in the sectoral labour market and help ensure the Union’s competitiveness. The Commission and Member States should also incentivise technological progress and resource efficiency in order to moderate the expected increase in Union consumption of critical raw materials below appropriate reference projections. In the context of preparing implementing measures pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), the Commission should consider the possible contribution of ecodesign requirements to the achievement of the Union priorities set out in this Regulation."

Effective support for Strategic Projects has the potential to improve access to strategic raw materials for downstream sectors, to create economic opportunities along the value chain, including for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to contribute to the creation of employment. Therefore, to ensure the development of Strategic Projects across the Union, such projects should benefit from streamlined and predictable permitting procedures and support in gaining access to finance. Such measures could also inspire improvements in other permitting procedures and in access to finance for projects related to critical or other raw materials. In order to focus support and ensure their added value, projects should, before receiving such support, be assessed against a set of criteria. Raw material projects where strategic raw materials are a by-product, including from ferrous scrap, should also be eligible for such support, if they meet all relevant criteria. In order to be recognised as Strategic Projects in the Union, projects should strengthen the Union’s security of supply for strategic raw materials. Projects should also show sufficient technical feasibility, including the expected volume of strategic raw materials or substitute materials by which they increase Union capacity, excluding materials produced for research purposes; be implemented in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner; and provide cross-border benefits beyond the Member State concerned, including spill-over effects further down the value chain. Where the Commission assesses those criteria to be fulfilled, it should publish the recognition as a Strategic Project by means of a decision.

In accordance with the waste hierarchy established in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (26), priority should be given to preventing the generation of waste containing critical raw materials, by extracting critical raw materials from the extracted volume prior to it becoming waste. In elaborating this study, operators should gather the necessary information, including concentrations and quantities of critical raw materials in the extractive waste, and carry out an assessment of multiple options regarding processes, operations or business arrangements that could enable an economically viable recovery of critical raw materials. This obligation comes in addition to obligations laid down in Directive 2006/21/EC and the national measures transposing that Directive and is directly applicable. In its implementation, operators and competent authorities should seek to minimise administrative burden and integrate procedures to the extent possible."

The information should be made publicly available and in a user-friendly and digital form, enabling access to more detailed, technical information. To facilitate user-friendly access to the information, Member States should, for instance, provide a point of contact to enable more in-depth exchanges with potential developers of critical raw materials recovery projects. The database should be designed to allow potential project promoters to easily identify facilities with a high potential for economically viable recovery. To focus limited resources, Member States should follow a staged approach in the gathering of information and carry out the more demanding information gathering steps only for the most promising facilities. The information gathering activities should aim to provide accurate and representative information on the extractive waste facilities and gaining the best possible indication of the critical raw materials recovery potential."

Electric motors should also be covered when included in other products. Most permanent magnets, in particular the most performant types, contain critical raw materials, such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, boron, samarium, nickel or cobalt. Their recycling is possible but today only performed in the Union at a small scale or in the context of research projects. Permanent magnets should therefore be a priority product for increasing circularity, thereby fostering a secondary market for permanent magnets and ensuring security of supply of critical raw materials."

In addition, to ensure a business case for permanent magnet recycling, permanent magnets incorporated in products placed on the Union market should, over time, contain an increasing amount of recycled raw materials. While providing transparency on the recycled content in a first stage, a minimum recycled content should be set after a dedicated assessment of the appropriate level and likely impacts."

      "text": "Critical raw materials sold on the Union market are often certified regarding the sustainability of their production and supply chain. Certification can be obtained in the context of a broad range of public and private certification schemes available with varying scopes and stringency, creating the potential for confusion regarding the nature and veracity of claims made about the relative sustainability of critical raw materials placed on the Union market on the basis of such certification. The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts recognising certification schemes that should be considered to be trustworthy, providing a common basis for relevant authorities and market participants for assessing the sustainability of critical raw materials. Recognition should be given only to certification schemes which contain provisions for independent third-party verification and monitoring of compliance. As regards environmental protection, certifications schemes should cover risks related to, for example, air, water, soil, biodiversity and waste management. The requirements on all sustainability dimensions should ensure a high level of social and environmental protection and should be consistent with Union law or the international instruments listed in an annex. To ensure efficient procedures, project promoters of projects applying to be recognised as Strategic Projects should be allowed to rely on participation in a recognised certification scheme as relevant evidence to show that their project is implemented sustainably, thereby contributing to a safe and sustainable supply of critical raw materials. When making use of that option, recognised certification schemes should cover all sustainability dimensions. In recognising such certification schemes, the Commission should take into account experience gained in assessing certification schemes in the context of other Union legislative acts, in particular regarding the assessment of similar schemes in the context of Regulations (EU) 2017/821 (27) and (EU) 2023/1542 (28) of the European Parliament and of the Council."

In order to limit such damage and incentivise the production of more sustainable critical raw materials, the Commission should be empowered to develop a system for the calculation of the environmental footprint of critical raw materials, including a verification process, to ensure that critical raw materials placed on the Union market publicly display information on such footprint and facilitating circularity of critical raw materials. The system should be based on taking into account scientifically sound assessment methods and relevant international standards in the area of life-cycle assessment. The requirement to declare the environmental footprint of a critical raw material should only apply where it has been concluded, on the basis of a dedicated assessment, that it would contribute to the Union’s climate and environmental objectives by facilitating the procurement of critical raw materials with lower environmental footprint and would not disproportionately affect trade flows and economic costs. When the relevant calculation rules have been adopted, the Commission should develop performance classes for critical raw materials, thereby allowing potential buyers to easily compare the relative environmental footprint of available critical raw materials and driving the market towards more sustainable raw materials. Sellers of critical raw materials should ensure that the environmental footprint declaration is available to their customers. Transparency on the relative footprint of critical raw materials placed on the Union market could also enable other policies at Union and national level, such as incentives or green public procurement criteria, fostering the production of critical raw materials with lower environmental impacts."
