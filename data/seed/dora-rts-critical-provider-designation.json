Considering the important number of ICT services and the diversity and number of financial institutions using those services, such a two-step approach should be undertaken to filter the population of ICT third-party service providers and identify the most critical ICT third-party service providers. The quantitative sub-criteria that are to be considered as part of the first step of the assessment are necessary to carry out a first selection of the population of ICT third-party service providers for which it is relevant to carry out a further in-depth analysis in light of the qualitative sub-criteria that are to be considered as part of the second step of the assessment."

Therefore, the importance of the activities of the financial entities that are supported by ICT services should be integrated in all sub-criteria considered as part of the first step. Consequently, there should not be a distinct quantitative assessment related to the criticality of the functions of the financial entities as part of the first step of the assessment. Instead, it is appropriate that the ESAs consider the criticality and importance of the functions of the financial entities supported by ICT services as part of the qualitative second step of the assessment."
