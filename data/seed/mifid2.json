Outsourcing of important operational functions may not be undertaken in such a way as to impair materially the quality of its internal control and the ability of the supervisor to monitor the firm’s compliance with all obligations.\n\nAn investment firm shall have sound administrative and accounting procedures, internal control mechanisms, effective procedures for risk assessment, and effective control and safeguard arrangements for information processing systems.\n\nWithout prejudice to the ability of competent authorities to require access to communications in accordance with this Directive and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, an investment firm shall have sound security mechanisms in place to guarantee the security and authentication of the means of transfer of information, minimise the risk of data corruption and unauthorised access and to prevent information leakage maintaining the confidentiality of the data at all times.\n\n6.   An investment firm shall arrange for records to be kept of all services, activities and transactions undertaken by it which shall be sufficient to enable the competent authority to fulfil its supervisory tasks and to perform the enforcement actions under this Directive, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, Directive 2014/57/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, and in particular to ascertain that the investment firm has complied with all obligations including those with respect to clients or potential clients and to the integrity of the market.\n\n7.   Records shall include the recording of telephone conversations or electronic communications relating to, at least, transactions concluded when dealing on own account and the provision of client order services that relate to the reception, transmission and execution of client orders.\n\nSuch telephone conversations and electronic communications shall also include those that are intended to result in transactions concluded when dealing on own account or in the provision of client order services that relate to the reception, transmission and execution of client orders, even if those conversations or communications do not result in the conclusion of such transactions or in the provision of client order services.\n\nFor those purposes, an investment firm shall take all reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations and electronic communications, made with, sent from or received by equipment provided by the investment firm to an employee or contractor or the use of which by an employee or contractor has been accepted or permitted by the investment firm.\n\nAn investment firm shall notify new and existing clients that telephone communications or conversations between the investment firm and its clients that result or may result in transactions will be recorded.\n\nSuch a notification may be made once, before the provision of investment services to new and existing clients.\n\nAn investment firm shall not provide, by telephone, investment services and activities to clients who have not been notified in advance about the recording of their telephone communications or conversations, where such investment services and activities relate to the reception, transmission and execution of client orders.\n\nOrders may be placed by clients through other channels, however such communications must be made in a durable medium such as mails, faxes, emails or documentation of client orders made at meetings. In particular, the content of relevant face-to-face conversations with a client may be recorded by using written minutes or notes. Such orders shall be considered equivalent to orders received by telephone.\n\nAn investment firm shall take all reasonable steps to prevent an employee or contractor from making, sending or receiving relevant telephone conversations and electronic communications on privately-owned equipment which the investment firm is unable to record or copy.\n\nThe records kept in accordance with this paragraph shall be provided to the client involved upon request and shall be kept for a period of five years and, where requested by the competent authority, for a period of up to seven years.\n\n8.   An investment firm shall, when holding financial instruments belonging to clients, make adequate arrangements so as to safeguard the ownership rights of clients, especially in the event of the investment firm’s insolvency, and to prevent the use of a client’s financial instruments on own account except with the client’s express consent.\n\n9.   An investment firm shall, when holding funds belonging to clients, make adequate arrangements to safeguard the rights of clients and, except in the case of credit institutions, prevent the use of client funds for its own account.\n\n10.   An investment firm shall not conclude title transfer financial collateral arrangements with retail clients for the purpose of securing or covering present or future, actual or contingent or prospective obligations of clients.\n\n11.   In the case of branches of investment firms, the competent authority of the Member State in which the branch is located shall, without prejudice to the possibility of the competent authority of the home Member State of the investment firm to have direct access to those records, enforce the obligation laid down in paragraphs 6 and 7 with regard to transactions undertaken by the branch.\n\nMember States may, in exceptional circumstances, impose requirements on investment firms concerning the safeguarding of client assets additional to the provisions set out in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 and the respective delegated acts as referred to in paragraph 12. Such requirements must be objectively justified and proportionate so as to address, where investment firms safeguard client assets and client funds, specific risks to investor protection or to market integrity which are of particular importance in the circumstances of the market structure of that Member State.\n\nMember States shall notify, without undue delay, the Commission of any requirement which they intend to impose in accordance with this paragraph and at least two months before the date appointed for that requirement to come into force. The notification shall include a justification for that requirement. Any such additional requirements shall not restrict or otherwise affect the rights of investment firms under Articles 34 and 35.\n\nThe Commission shall within two months of the notification referred to in the third subparagraph provide its opinion on the proportionality of and justification for the additional requirements.\n\nMember States may retain additional requirements provided that they were notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2006/73/EC before 2 July 2014 and that the conditions laid down in that Article are met.\n\nThe Commission shall communicate to Member States and make public on its website the additional requirements imposed in accordance with this paragraph.\n\n12.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to specify the concrete organisational requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 10 of this Article to be imposed on investment firms and on branches of third-country firms authorised in accordance with Article 41 performing different investment services and/or activities and ancillary services or combinations thereof.",

Where applicable, such information shall be provided to the client on a regular basis, at least annually, during the life of the investment.\n\n5.   The information referred to in paragraphs 4 and 9 shall be provided in a comprehensible form in such a manner that clients or potential clients are reasonably able to understand the nature and risks of the investment service and of the specific type of financial instrument that is being offered and, consequently, to take investment decisions on an informed basis.

The market operator shall make public its decision on the suspension or removal of the financial instrument and of any related derivative and communicate the relevant decisions to its competent authority.\n\nThe competent authority, in whose jurisdiction the suspension or removal originated, shall require that other regulated markets, MTFs, OTFs and systematic internalisers, which fall under its jurisdiction and trade the same financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to this Directive that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument, also suspend or remove that financial instrument or derivatives from trading, where the suspension or removal is due to suspected market abuse, a take-over bid or the non-disclosure of inside information about the issuer or financial instrument infringing Articles 7 and 17 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 except where such suspension or removal could cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the market.\n\nEach notified competent authority shall communicate its decision to ESMA and other competent authorities, including an explanation if the decision was not to suspend or remove from trading the financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument.\n\nThe competent authority shall immediately make public and communicate to ESMA and the competent authorities of the other Member States such a decision.\n\nThe notified competent authorities of the other Member States shall require that regulated markets, other MTFs, other OTFs and systematic internalisers, which fall under their jurisdiction and trade the same financial instrument or derivatives referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to this Directive that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument, also suspend or remove that financial instrument or derivatives from trading, where the suspension or removal is due to suspected market abuse, a take-over bid or the non-disclosure of inside information about the issuer or financial instrument infringing Articles 7 and 17 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 except where such suspension or removal could cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the market.\n\nThis paragraph applies also when the suspension from trading of a financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument is lifted.\n\nThe notification procedure referred to in this paragraph shall also apply in the case where the decision to suspend or remove from trading a financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument is taken by the competent authority pursuant to points (m) and (n) of Article 69(2).\n\nIn order to ensure that the obligation to suspend or remove from trading such derivatives is applied proportionately, ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the cases in which the connection between a derivative relating or referenced to a financial instrument suspended or removed from trading and the original financial instrument implies that the derivative are also to be suspended or removed from trading, in order to achieve the objective of the suspension or removal of the underlying financial instrument.\n\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n3.   ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to determine the format and timing of the communications and publications referred to in paragraph 2.\n\nESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 3 January 2016.\n\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to specify the list of circumstances constituting significant damage to the investors’ interests and the orderly functioning of the market referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.",

That position limit shall include economically equivalent OTC contracts.\n\nA competent authority shall review position limits where there is a significant change in deliverable supply or open interest or any other significant change on the market, based on its determination of deliverable supply and open interest and reset the position limit in accordance with the methodology for calculation developed by ESMA.\n\n5.   Competent authorities shall notify ESMA of the exact position limits they intend to set in accordance with the methodology for calculation established by ESMA under paragraph 3. Within two months following receipt of the notification, ESMA shall issue an opinion to the competent authority concerned assessing the compatibility of position limits with the objectives of paragraph 1 and with the methodology for calculation established by ESMA under paragraph 3. ESMA shall publish the opinion on its website. The competent authority concerned shall modify the position limits in accordance with ESMA’s opinion, or provide ESMA with justification why the change is considered to be unnecessary. Where a competent authority imposes limits contrary to an ESMA opinion, it shall immediately publish on its website a notice fully explaining its reasons for doing so.\n\nWhere ESMA determines that a position limit is not in line with the methodology for calculation in paragraph 3, it shall take action in accordance with its powers under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n6.   Where the same commodity derivative is traded in significant volumes on trading venues in more than one jurisdiction, the competent authority of the trading venue where the largest volume of trading takes place (the central competent authority) shall set the single position limit to be applied on all trading in that contract. The central competent authority shall consult the competent authorities of other trading venues on which that derivative is traded in significant volumes on the single position limit to be applied and any revisions to that single position limit.

In doing so, ESMA shall ensure that a single position limit effectively applies to the same contract irrespective of where it is traded in line with paragraph 6.\n\n8.   Member States shall ensure that an investment firm or a market operator operating a trading venue which trades commodity derivatives apply position management controls. Those controls shall include at least, the powers for the trading venue to:\n\n(a)\n\nmonitor the open interest positions of persons;\n\n(b)\n\naccess information, including all relevant documentation, from persons about the size and purpose of a position or exposure entered into, information about beneficial or underlying owners, any concert arrangements, and any related assets or liabilities in the underlying market;\n\n(c)\n\nrequire a person to terminate or reduce a position, on a temporary or permanent basis as the specific case may require and to unilaterally take appropriate action to ensure the termination or reduction if the person does not comply; and\n\n(d)\n\nwhere appropriate, require a person to provide liquidity back into the market at an agreed price and volume on a temporary basis with the express intent of mitigating the effects of a large or dominant position.\n\n9.   The position limits and position management controls shall be transparent and non-discriminatory, specifying how they apply to persons and taking account of the nature and composition of market participants and of the use they make of the contracts submitted to trading.\n\n10.   The investment firm or market operator operating the trading venue shall inform the competent authority of the details of position management controls.\n\nThe competent authority shall communicate the same information as well as the details of the position limits it has established to ESMA, which shall publish and maintain on its website a database with summaries of the position limits and position management controls.\n\n11.   The position limits of paragraph 1 shall be imposed by competent authorities pursuant to point (p) of Article 69(2).\n\n12.   ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine:\n\n(a)\n\nthe criteria and methods for determining whether a position qualifies as reducing risks directly relating to commercial activities;\n\n(b)\n\nthe methods to determine when positions of a person are to be aggregated within a group;\n\n(c)\n\nthe criteria for determining whether a contract is an economically equivalent OTC contract to that traded on a trading venue, referred to in paragraph 1, in a way that facilitates the reporting of positions taken in equivalent OTC contracts to the relevant competent authority as determined in Article 58(2);\n\n(d)\n\nthe definition of what constitutes the same commodity derivative and significant volumes under paragraph 6 of this Article;\n\n(e)\n\nthe methodology for aggregating and netting OTC and on-venue commodity derivatives positions to establish the net position for purposes of assessing compliance with the limits.

Competent authorities shall publish on their website the details of the more restrictive position limits they decide to impose, which shall be valid for an initial period not exceeding six months from the date of their publication on the website. The more restrictive position limits may be renewed for further periods not exceeding six months at a time if the grounds for the restriction continue to be applicable. If not renewed after that six-month period, they shall automatically expire.\n\nWhere competent authorities decide to impose more restrictive position limits, they shall notify ESMA. The notification shall include a justification for the more restrictive position limits. ESMA shall, within 24 hours, issue an opinion on whether it considers that the more restrictive position limits are necessary to address the exceptional case. The opinion shall be published on ESMA’s website.\n\nWhere a competent authority imposes limits contrary to an ESMA opinion, it shall immediately publish on its website a notice fully explaining its reasons for doing so.\n\n14.   Member States shall provide that competent authorities can apply their powers to impose sanctions under this Directive for the infringements of position limits set in accordance with this Article to:\n\n(a)\n\npositions held by persons situated or operating in its territory or abroad which exceed the limits on commodity derivative contracts the competent authority has set in relation to contracts on trading venues situated or operating in its territory or economically equivalent OTC contracts;\n\n(b)\n\npositions held by persons situated or operating in its territory which exceed the limits on commodity derivative contracts set by competent authorities in other Member States.",

Such agreement shall specify whether this applies to one or more particular services or transactions, or to one or more types of product or transaction.\n\nII.   CLIENTS WHO MAY BE TREATED AS PROFESSIONALS ON REQUEST\n\nII.1.   Identification criteria\n\nClients other than those mentioned in section I, including public sector bodies, local public authorities, municipalities and private individual investors, may also be allowed to waive some of the protections afforded by the conduct of business rules.\n\nInvestment firms shall therefore be allowed to treat any of those clients as professionals provided the relevant criteria and procedure mentioned below are fulfilled. Those clients shall not, however, be presumed to possess market knowledge and experience comparable to that of the categories listed in Section I.\n\nAny such waiver of the protection afforded by the standard conduct of business regime shall be considered to be valid only if an adequate assessment of the expertise, experience and knowledge of the client, undertaken by the investment firm, gives reasonable assurance, in light of the nature of the transactions or services envisaged, that the client is capable of making investment decisions and understanding the risks involved.\n\nThe fitness test applied to managers and directors of entities licensed under Directives in the financial field could be regarded as an example of the assessment of expertise and knowledge. In the case of small entities, the person subject to that assessment shall be the person authorised to carry out transactions on behalf of the entity.\n\nIn the course of that assessment, as a minimum, two of the following criteria shall be satisfied:\n\n—\n\nthe client has carried out transactions, in significant size, on the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four quarters,\n\n—\n\nthe size of the client’s financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and financial instruments exceeds EUR 500 000,\n\n—\n\nthe client works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position, which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged.\n\nMember States may adopt specific criteria for the assessment of the expertise and knowledge of municipalities and local public authorities requesting to be treated as professional clients. Those criteria can be alternative or additional to those listed in the fifth paragraph.\n\nII.2.   Procedure\n\nThose clients may waive the benefit of the detailed rules of conduct only where the following procedure is followed:\n\n—\n\nthey must state in writing to the investment firm that they wish to be treated as a professional client, either generally or in respect of a particular investment service or transaction, or type of transaction or product,\n\n—\n\nthe investment firm must give them a clear written warning of the protections and investor compensation rights they may lose,\n\n—\n\nthey must state in writing, in a separate document from the contract, that they are aware of the consequences of losing such protections.\n\nBefore deciding to accept any request for waiver, investment firms must be required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the client requesting to be treated as a professional client meets the relevant requirements stated in Section II.1.\n\nHowever, if clients have already been categorised as professionals under parameters and procedures similar to those referred to above, it is not intended that their relationships with investment firms shall be affected by any new rules adopted pursuant to this Annex.\n\nFirms must implement appropriate written internal policies and procedures to categorise clients. Professional clients are responsible for keeping the investment firm informed about any change, which could affect their current categorisation. Should the investment firm become aware however that the client no longer fulfils the initial conditions, which made him eligible for a professional treatment, the investment firm shall take appropriate action.\n\nANNEX III\n\nPART A\n\nRepealed Directive with list of its successive amendments\n\n(referred to in Article 94)\n\nDirective 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1).\n\nDirective 2006/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 114, 27.4.2006, p. 60).\n\nDirective 2007/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 247, 21.9.2007, p. 1).\n\nDirective 2008/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 76, 19.3.2008, p. 33).\n\nDirective 2010/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 120).\n\nPART B\n\nList of time-limits for transposition into national law\n\n(referred to in Article 94)\n\nDirective 2004/39/EC\n\nTransposition period\n\n31 January 2007\n\nImplementation period\n\n1 November 2007\n\nDirective 2006/31/EC\n\nTransposition period\n\n31 January 2007\n\nImplementation period\n\n1 November 2007\n\nDirective 2007/44/EC\n\nTransposition period\n\n21 March 2009\n\nDirective 2010/78/EC\n\nTransposition period\n\n31 December 2011\n\nANNEX IV\n\nCorrelation table referred in Article 94\n\nDirective 2004/39/EC\n\nDirective 2014/65/EU\n\nRegulation (EU) No 600/2014\n\nArticle 1(1)\n\nArticle 1(1)\n\nArticle 1(2)\n\nArticle 1(3)\n\nArticle 2(1)(a)\n\nArticle 2(1)(a)\n\nArticle 2(1)(b)\n\nArticle 2(1)(b)\n\nArticle 2(1)(c)\n\nArticle 2(1)(c)\n\nArticle 2(1)(d)\n\nArticle 2(1)(d)\n\nArticle 2(1)(e)\n\nArticle 2(1)(f)\n\nArticle 2(1)(f)\n\nArticle 2(1)(g)\n\nArticle 2(1)(g)\n\nArticle 2(1)(h)\n\nArticle 2(1)(h)\n\nArticle 2(1)(i)\n\nArticle 2(1)(i)\n\nArticle 2(1)(j)\n\nArticle 2(1)(j)\n\nArticle 2(1)(k)\n\nArticle 2(1)(k)\n\nArticle 2(1)(i)\n\nArticle 2(1)(l)\n\n—\n\nArticle 2(1)(m)\n\nArticle 2(1)(l)\n\nArticle 2(1)(n)\n\nArticle 2(1)(m)\n\nArticle 2(2)\n\nArticle 2(2)\n\nArticle 2(3)\n\nArticle 2(4)\n\nArticle 3(1)\n\nArticle 3(1)\n\nArticle 3(2)\n\nArticle 3(3)\n\nArticle 4(1)(1)\n\nArticle 4(1)(1)\n\nArticle 4(1)(2)\n\nArticle 4(1)(2)\n\nArticle 4(1)(3)\n\nArticle 4(1)(3)\n\nArticle 4(1)(4)\n\nArticle 4(1)(4)\n\nArticle 4(1)(5)\n\nArticle 4(1)(5)\n\nArticle 4(1)(6)\n\nArticle 4(1)(6)\n\nArticle 4(1)(7)\n\nArticle 4(1)(20)\n\nArticle 4(1)(8)\n\nArticle 4(1)(7)\n\nArticle 4(1)(9)\n\nArticle 4(1)(8)\n\nArticle 4(1)(10)\n\nArticle 4(1)(9)\n\nArticle 4(1)(11)\n\nArticle 4(1)(10)\n\nArticle 4(1)(12)\n\nArticle 4(1)(11)\n\nArticle 4(1)(13)\n\nArticle 4(1)(18)\n\nArticle 4(1)(14)\n\nArticle 4(1)(21)\n\nArticle 4(1)(15)\n\nArticle 4(1)(22)\n\nArticle 4(1)(16)\n\nArticle 4(1)(14)\n\nArticle 4(1)(17)\n\nArticle 4(1)(15)\n\nArticle 4(1)(18)\n\nArticle 4(1)(44)\n\nArticle 4(1)(19)\n\nArticle 4(1)(17)\n\nArticle 4(1)(20)\n\nArticle 4(1)(55)\n\nArticle 4(1)(21)\n\nArticle 4(1)(56)\n\nArticle 4(1)(22)\n\nArticle 4(1)(26)\n\nArticle 4(1)(23)\n\nArticle 4(1)(27)\n\nArticle 4(1)(24)\n\nArticle 4(1)(28)\n\nArticle 4(1)(25)\n\nArticle 4(1)(29)\n\nArticle 4(1)(26)\n\nArticle 4(1)(30)\n\nArticle 4(1)(27)\n\nArticle 4(1)(31)\n\nArticle 4(1)(28)\n\nArticle 4(1)(32)\n\nArticle 4(1)(29)\n\nArticle 4(1)(33)\n\nArticle 4(1)(30)\n\nArticle 4(1)(35)(b)\n\nArticle 4(1)(31)\n\nArticle 4(1)(35)\n\nArticle 4(2)\n\nArticle 4(2)\n\nArticle 5(1)\n\nArticle 5(1)\n\nArticle 5(2)\n\nArticle 5(2)\n\nArticle 5(3)\n\nArticle 5(3)\n\nArticle 5(4)\n\nArticle 5(4)\n\nArticle 5(5)\n\n—\n\nArticle 6(1)\n\nArticle 6(1)\n\nArticle 6(2)\n\nArticle 6(2)\n\nArticle 6(3)\n\nArticle 6(3)\n\nArticle 7(1)\n\nArticle 7(1)\n\nArticle 7(2)\n\nArticle 7(2)\n\nArticle 7(3)\n\nArticle 7(3)\n\nArticle 7(4)\n\nArticle 7(4) and (5)\n\nArticle 8(a)\n\nArticle 8(a)\n\nArticle 8(b)\n\nArticle 8(b)\n\nArticle 8(c)\n\nArticle 8(c)\n\nArticle 8(d)\n\nArticle 8(d)\n\nArticle 8(e)\n\nArticle 8(e)\n\nArticle 9(1)\n\nArticle 9(1) and (3)\n\nArticle 9(2)\n\nArticle 9(5)\n\nArticle 9(3)\n\nArticle 9(4)\n\nArticle 9(4)\n\nArticle 9(6)\n\nArticle 10(1)\n\nArticle 10(1)\n\nArticle 10(2)\n\nArticle 10(2)\n\nArticle 10(3)\n\nArticle 11(1)\n\nArticle 10(4)\n\nArticle 11(2)\n\nArticle 10(5)\n\nArticle 11(3)\n\nArticle 10(6)\n\nArticle 10(3), 11(4)\n\nArticle 10a(1)\n\nArticle 12(1)\n\nArticle 10a(2)\n\nArticle 12(2)\n\nArticle 10a(3)\n\nArticle 12(3)\n\nArticle 10a(4)\n\nArticle 12(4)\n\nArticle 10a(5)\n\nArticle 12(5)\n\nArticle 10a(6)\n\nArticle 12(6)\n\nArticle 10a(7)\n\nArticle 12(7)\n\nArticle 10a(8)\n\nArticle 12(8) and (9)\n\nArticle 10b(1)\n\nArticle 13(1)\n\nArticle 10b(2)\n\nArticle 13(2)\n\nArticle 10b(3)\n\nArticle 13(3)\n\nArticle 10b(4)\n\nArticle 13(4)\n\nArticle 10b(5)\n\nArticle 13(5)",
