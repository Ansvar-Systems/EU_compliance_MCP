National regulatory or other competent authorities may suspend the further granting of rights of use for numbering resources to such undertakings if it is demonstrated that there is a risk of exhaustion of numbering resources.\n\nBy 21 June 2020, in order to contribute to the consistent application of this paragraph, BEREC shall adopt, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, guidelines on common criteria for the assessment of the ability to manage numbering resources and of the risk of exhaustion of numbering resources.\n\n3.   National regulatory or other competent authorities shall ensure that national numbering plans and procedures are applied in a manner that gives equal treatment to all providers of publicly available electronic communications services and the undertakings eligible in accordance with paragraph 2.

Where rights of use for numbering resources have been granted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks or services, this paragraph shall apply to the specific services for the provision of which the rights of use have been granted.\n\nNational regulatory or other competent authorities shall ensure that the conditions listed in Part E of Annex I that may be attached to the rights of use for numbering resources used for the provision of services outside the Member State of the country code, and their enforcement, are as stringent as the conditions and enforcement applicable to services provided within the Member State of the country code, in accordance with this Directive. National regulatory or other competent authorities shall also ensure in accordance with Article 94(6) that providers using numbering resources of their country code in other Member States comply with consumer protection and other national rules related to the use of numbering resources applicable in those Member States where the numbering resources are used. This obligation is without prejudice to the enforcement powers of the competent authorities of those Member States.\n\nBEREC shall assist national regulatory or other competent authorities, at their request, in coordinating their activities to ensure the efficient management of numbering resources with a right of extraterritorial use within the Union.\n\nIn order to facilitate the monitoring by the national regulatory or other competent authorities of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph, BEREC shall establish a database on the numbering resources with a right of extraterritorial use within the Union. For this purpose, national regulatory or other competent authorities shall transmit the relevant information to BEREC. Where numbering resources with a right of extraterritorial use within the Union are not granted by the national regulatory authority, the competent authority responsible for their granting or management shall consult the national regulatory authority.\n\n5.   Member States shall ensure that the ‘00’ code is the standard international access code. Special arrangements for the use of number-based interpersonal communications services between locations adjacent to one another across borders between Member States may be established or continued.\n\nMember States may agree to share a common numbering plan for all or specific categories of numbers.\n\nEnd-users affected by such arrangements or agreements shall be fully informed.\n\n6.   Without prejudice to Article 106, Member States shall promote over-the-air provisioning, where technically feasible, to facilitate switching of providers of electronic communications networks or services by end-users, in particular providers and end-users of machine-to-machine services.\n\n7.   Member States shall ensure that the national numbering plans, and all subsequent additions or amendments thereto, are published, subject only to limitations imposed on the grounds of national security.\n\n8.   Member States shall support the harmonisation of specific numbers or numbering ranges within the Union where it promotes both the functioning of the internal market and the development of pan-European services. Where necessary to address unmet cross-border or pan-European demand for numbering resources, the Commission shall, taking utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, adopt implementing acts harmonising specific numbers or numbering ranges.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 118(4).",

TELEVISION AND RADIO SERVICES BROADCAST TO VIEWERS AND LISTENERS IN THE UNION\n\nPart I\n\nConditions for conditional access systems to be applied in accordance with Article 62(1)\n\nIn relation to conditional access to digital television and radio services broadcast to viewers and listeners in the Union, irrespective of the means of transmission, Member States shall ensure in accordance with Article 62 that the following conditions apply:\n\n(a)\n\nall undertakings providing conditional access services, irrespective of the means of transmission, which provide access services to digital television and radio services and the access services of which broadcasters depend on to reach any group of potential viewers or listeners are to:\n\n—\n\noffer to all broadcasters, on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis compatible with Union competition law, technical services enabling the broadcasters’ digitally-transmitted services to be received by viewers or listeners authorised by means of decoders administered by the service operators, and comply with Union competition law,\n\n—\n\nkeep separate financial accounts regarding their activity as conditional access providers.\n\n(b)\n\nwhen granting licences to manufacturers of consumer equipment, holders of industrial property rights to conditional access products and systems are to ensure that this is done on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Taking into account technical and commercial factors, holders of rights are not to subject the granting of licences to conditions prohibiting, deterring or discouraging the inclusion in the same product of:\n\n—\n\na common interface allowing connection with several other access systems, or\n\n—\n\nmeans specific to another access system, provided that the licensee complies with the relevant and reasonable conditions ensuring, as far as he is concerned, the security of transactions of conditional access system operators.\n\nPart II\n\nOther facilities to which conditions may be applied under point (D) of Article 61(2)\n\n(a)\n\nAccess to APIs;\n\n(b)\n\nAccess to EPGs.\n\nANNEX III\n\nCRITERIA FOR THE DETERMINATION OF WHOLESALE VOICE TERMINATION RATES\n\nPrinciples, criteria and parameters for the determination of rates for wholesale voice termination on fixed and mobile markets referred to in Article 75(1):\n\n(a)\n\nrates shall be based on the recovery of costs incurred by an efficient operator; the evaluation of efficient costs shall be based on current cost values; the cost methodology to calculate efficient costs shall be based on a bottom-up modelling approach using long-run incremental traffic-related costs of providing the wholesale voice termination service to third parties;\n\n(b)\n\nthe relevant incremental costs of the wholesale voice termination service shall be determined by the difference between the total long-run costs of an operator providing its full range of services and the total long-run costs of that operator not providing a wholesale voice termination service to third parties;\n\n(c)\n\nonly those traffic-related costs which would be avoided in the absence of a wholesale voice termination service being provided shall be allocated to the relevant termination increment;\n\n(d)\n\ncosts related to additional network capacity shall be included only to the extent that they are driven by the need to increase capacity for the purpose of carrying additional wholesale voice termination traffic;\n\n(e)\n\nradio spectrum fees shall be excluded from the mobile voice termination increment;\n\n(f)\n\nonly those wholesale commercial costs shall be included which are directly related to the provision of the wholesale voice termination service to third parties;\n\n(g)\n\nall fixed network operators shall be considered to provide voice termination services at the same unit costs as the efficient operator, regardless of their size;\n\n(h)\n\nfor mobile network operators, the minimum efficient scale shall be set at a market share not below 20 %;\n\n(i)\n\nthe relevant approach for asset depreciation shall be economic depreciation; and\n\n(j)\n\nthe technology choice of the modelled networks shall be forward looking, based on an IP core network, taking into account the various technologies likely to be used over the period of validity of the maximum rate; in the case of fixed networks, calls shall be considered to be exclusively packet switched.\n\nANNEX IV\n\nCRITERIA FOR ASSESSING CO-INVESTMENT OFFERS\n\nWhen assessing a co-investment offer pursuant to Article 76(1), the national regulatory authority shall verify whether the following criteria have at a minimum been met. National regulatory authorities may consider additional criteria to the extent they are necessary to ensure accessibility of potential investors to the co-investment, in light of specific local conditions and market structure:\n\n(a)\n\nThe co-investment offer shall be open to any undertaking over the lifetime of the network built under a co-investment offer on a non-discriminatory basis. The undertaking designated as having significant market power may include in the offer reasonable conditions regarding the financial capacity of any undertaking, so that for instance potential co-investors need to demonstrate their ability to deliver phased payments on the basis of which the deployment is planned, the acceptance of a strategic plan on the basis of which medium-term deployment plans are prepared, and so on.\n\n(b)\n\nThe co-investment offer shall be transparent:\n\n—\n\nthe offer shall be available and easily identified on the website of the undertaking designated as having significant market power;\n\n—\n\nfull detailed terms shall be made available without undue delay to any potential bidder that has expressed an interest, including the legal form of the co-investment agreement and, when relevant, the heads of term of the governance rules of the co-investment vehicle; and\n\n—\n\nthe process, like the road map for the establishment and development of the co-investment project shall be set in advance, shall be clearly explained in writing to any potential co-investor, and all significant milestones shall be clearly communicated to all undertakings without any discrimination.\n\n(c)\n\nThe co-investment offer shall include terms to potential co-investors which favour sustainable competition in the long term, in particular:\n\n—\n\nAll undertakings shall be offered fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for participation in the co-investment agreement relative to the time they join, including in terms of financial consideration required for the acquisition of specific rights, in terms of the protection awarded to the co-investors by those rights both during the building phase and during the exploitation phase, for example by granting indefeasible rights of use (IRUs) for the expected lifetime of the co-invested network and in terms of the conditions for joining and potentially terminating the co-investment agreement. Non-discriminatory terms in this context do not entail that all potential co-investors shall be offered exactly the same terms, including financial terms, but that all variations of the terms offered shall be justified on the basis of the same objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable criteria such as the number of end-user lines committed for.\n\n—\n\nThe offer shall allow flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the commitment provided by each co-investor, for example by means of an agreed and potentially increasing percentage of the total end-user lines in a given area, to which co-investors have the possibility to commit gradually and which is set at a unit level enabling smaller co-investors with limited resources to enter the co-investment at a reasonably minimum scale and to gradually increase their participation while ensuring adequate levels of initial commitment. The determination of the financial consideration to be provided by each co-investor needs to reflect the fact that early investors accept greater risks and engage capital sooner.\n\n—\n\nA premium increasing over time shall be considered to be justified for commitments made at later stages and for new co-investors entering the co-investment after the commencement of the project, to reflect diminishing risks and to counteract any incentive to withhold capital in the earlier stages.\n\n—\n\nThe co-investment agreement shall allow the assignment of acquired rights by co-investors to other co-investors, or to third parties willing to enter into the co-investment agreement subject to the transferee undertaking being obliged to fulfil all original obligations of the transferor under the co-investment agreement.\n\n—\n\nCo-investors shall grant each other reciprocal rights on fair and reasonable terms and conditions to access the co-invested infrastructure for the purposes of providing services downstream, including to end-users, in accordance with transparent conditions which are to be made transparent in the co-investment offer and subsequent agreement, in particular where co-investors are individually and separately responsible for the deployment of specific parts of the network. If a co-investment vehicle is created, it shall provide access to the network to all co-investors, whether directly or indirectly, on an equivalence of inputs basis and in accordance with fair and reasonable terms and conditions, including financial conditions that reflect the different levels of risk accepted by the individual co-investors.\n\n(d)\n\nThe co-investment offer shall ensure a sustainable investment likely to meet future needs, by deploying new network elements that contribute significantly to the deployment of very high capacity networks.\n\nANNEX V\n\nMINIMUM SET OF SERVICES WHICH THE ADEQUATE BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 84(3) SHALL BE CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING\n\n(1)\n\nE-mail\n\n(2)\n\nsearch engines enabling search and finding of all type of information\n\n(3)\n\nbasic training and education online tools\n\n(4)\n\nonline newspapers or news\n\n(5)\n\nbuying or ordering goods or services online\n\n(6)\n\njob searching and job searching tools\n\n(7)\n\nprofessional networking\n\n(8)\n\ninternet banking\n\n(9)\n\neGovernment service use\n\n(10)\n\nsocial media and instant messaging\n\n(11)\n\ncalls and video calls (standard quality)\n\nANNEX VI\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES AND SERVICES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 88 (CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE), ARTICLE 115 (ADDITIONAL FACILITIES) AND ARTICLE 106 (PROVIDER SWITCHING AND NUMBER PORTABILITY)\n\nPart A\n\nFacilities and services referred to in Articles 88 and 115\n\nWhen applied on the basis of Article 88, Part A is applicable to consumers and other categories of end-users where Member States have extended the beneficiaries of Article 88(2).\n\nWhen applied on the basis of Article 115, Part A is applicable to the categories of end-users determined by Member States, except for points (c), (d) and (g) of this Part which are applicable only to consumers.\n\n(a)\n\nItemised billing\n\nMember States shall ensure that competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities, subject to the requirements of relevant law on the protection of personal data and privacy, may lay down the basic level of itemised bills which are to be offered by providers to end-users free of charge in order that they can:\n\n(i)\n\nallow verification and control of the charges incurred in using internet access services or voice communications services, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115; and\n\n(ii)\n\nadequately monitor their usage and expenditure and thereby exercise a reasonable degree of control over their bills.\n\nWhere appropriate, additional levels of detail may be offered to end-users at reasonable tariffs or at no charge.\n\nSuch itemised bills shall include an explicit mention of the identity of the supplier and of the duration of the services charged by any premium numbers unless the end-user has requested that information not to be mentioned.\n\nCalls which are free of charge to the calling end-users, including calls to helplines, shall not be required to be identified in the calling end-user’s itemised bill.\n\nNational regulatory authorities may require operators to provide calling-line identification free of charge.\n\n(b)\n\nSelective barring for outgoing calls or premium SMS or MMS, or, where technically feasible, other kinds of similar applications, free of charge\n\nnamely, the facility whereby the end-users can, on request to the providers of voice communications services, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115, bar outgoing calls or premium SMS or MMS or other kinds of similar applications of defined types or to defined types of numbers free of charge.\n\n(c)\n\nPre-payment systems\n\nMember States shall ensure that competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities may require providers to offer means for consumers to pay for access to the public electronic communications network and use of voice communications services, or internet access services, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115, on pre-paid terms.\n\n(d)\n\nPhased payment of connection fees\n\nMember States shall ensure that competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities may require providers to allow consumers to pay for connection to the public electronic communications network on the basis of payments phased over time.\n\n(e)\n\nNon-payment of bills\n\nMember States shall authorise specified measures, which are to be proportionate, non-discriminatory and published, to cover non-payment of bills issued by providers. Those measures are to ensure that due warning of any consequent service interruption or disconnection is given to the end-users beforehand. Except in cases of fraud, persistent late payment or non-payment, those measures shall ensure, as far as is technically feasible, that any service interruption is confined to the service concerned. Disconnection for non-payment of bills shall take place only after due warning is given to the end-users. Member States may allow a period of limited service prior to complete disconnection, during which only calls that do not incur a charge to the end-users (for example, calls to the ‘112’ number) and minimum service level of internet access services, defined by Member States in light of national conditions, are permitted.\n\n(f)\n\nTariff advice\n\nnamely, the facility whereby end-users may request the provider to offer information regarding alternative lower-cost tariffs, if available.\n\n(g)\n\nCost control\n\nnamely, the facility whereby providers offer other means, if determined to be appropriate by competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities, to control the costs of voice communications services or internet access services, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115, including free-of-charge alerts to consumers in the case of abnormal or excessive consumption patterns.\n\n(h)\n\nfacility to deactivate third party billing\n\nnamely, the facility for end-users to deactivate the ability for third party service providers to use the bill of a provider of an internet access service or a provider of a publicly available interpersonal communications service to charge for their products or services.\n\nPart B\n\nFacilities referred to in Article 115\n\n(a)\n\nCalling-line identification\n\nnamely, the calling party’s number is presented to the called party prior to the call being established.\n\nThis facility shall be provided in accordance with relevant law on protection of personal data and privacy, in particular Directive 2002/58/EC.\n\nTo the extent technically feasible, operators shall provide data and signals to facilitate the offering of calling-line identity and tone dialling across Member State boundaries.\n\n(b)\n\nE-mail forwarding or access to e-mails after termination of the contract with a provider of an internet access service.\n\nThis facility shall, on request and free-of-charge, enable end-users who terminate their contract with a provider of an internet access service to either access their e-mails received on the e-mail address(es) based on the commercial name or trade mark of the former provider, during a period that the national regulatory authority considers necessary and proportionate, or to transfer e-mails sent to that (or those) address(es) during that period to a new email address specified by the end-user.\n\nPart C\n\nImplementation of the number portability provisions referred to in Article 106\n\nThe requirement that all end-users with numbers from the national numbering plan, who so request can retain their numbers independently of the undertaking providing the service shall apply:\n\n(a)\n\nin the case of geographic numbers, at a specific location; and\n\n(b)\n\nin the case of non-geographic numbers, at any location.\n\nThis Part does not apply to the porting of numbers between networks providing services at a fixed location and mobile networks.\n\nANNEX VII\n\nCALCULATING THE NET COST, IF ANY, OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND ESTABLISHING ANY COMPENSATION OR SHARING MECHANISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 89 AND 90\n\nPart A\n\nCalculation of net cost\n\nUniversal service obligations refer to those obligations placed upon an undertaking by a Member State which concern the provision of universal service as set out in Articles 84 to 87.\n\nNational regulatory authorities are to consider all means to ensure appropriate incentives for undertakings (designated or not) to provide universal service obligations cost efficiently. In undertaking a calculation exercise, the net cost of universal service obligations is to be calculated as the difference between the net cost for any undertaking operating with the universal service obligations and operating without the universal service obligations. Due attention is to be given to correctly assessing the costs that any undertaking would have chosen to avoid had there been no universal service obligations. The net cost calculation shall assess the benefits, including intangible benefits, to the universal service provider.\n\nThe calculation is to be based upon the costs attributable to:\n\n(i)\n\nelements of the identified services which can only be provided at a loss or provided under cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards.\n\nThis category may include service elements such as access to emergency telephone services, provision of certain public pay telephones, provision of certain services or equipment for end-users with disabilities, and so on;\n\n(ii)\n\nspecific end-users or groups of end-users who, taking into account the cost of providing the specified network and service, the revenue generated and any geographical averaging of prices imposed by the Member State, can only be served at a loss or under cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards.\n\nThis category includes those end-users or groups of end-users which would not be served by a commercial provider which did not have an obligation to provide universal service.\n\nThe calculation of the net cost of specific aspects of universal service obligations is to be made separately and in order to avoid the double counting of any direct or indirect benefits and costs. The overall net cost of universal service obligations to any undertaking is to be calculated as the sum of the net costs arising from the specific components of universal service obligations, taking account of any intangible benefits. The responsibility for verifying the net cost lies with the national regulatory authority.\n\nPart B\n\nCompensation of net costs of universal service obligations\n\nThe recovery or financing of any net costs of universal service obligations may require undertakings with universal service obligations to be compensated for the services they provide under non-commercial conditions. Because such a compensation involves financial transfers, Member States are to ensure that those are undertaken in an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate manner. This means that the transfers result in the least distortion to competition and to user demand.\n\nIn accordance with Article 90(3), a sharing mechanism based on a fund shall use a transparent and neutral means for collecting contributions that avoids the danger of a double imposition of contributions falling on both outputs and inputs of undertakings.\n\nThe independent body administering the fund is to be responsible for collecting contributions from undertakings which are assessed as liable to contribute to the net cost of universal service obligations in the Member State and is to oversee the transfer of sums due or administrative payments to the undertakings entitled to receive payments from the fund.\n\nANNEX VIII\n\nINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS TO BE PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 102 (INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTS)\n\nA.\n\nInformation requirements for providers of publicly available electronic communications services other than transmission services used for the provision of machine-to-machine services\n\nProviders of publicly available electronic communications services other than transmission services used for the provision of machine-to-machine services shall provide the following information:\n\n(1)\n\nas part of the main characteristics of each service provided, any minimum levels of quality of service to the extent that those are offered and, for services other than internet access services, the specific quality parameters assured.\n\nWhere no minimum levels of quality of service are offered, a statement to this effect shall be made;\n\n(2)\n\nas part of the information on price, where and to the extent applicable, the respective prices for activating the electronic communications service and for any recurring or consumption-related charges;\n\n(3)\n\nas part of the information on the duration of the contract and the conditions for renewal and termination of the contract, including possible termination fees, to the extent that such conditions apply:\n\n(i)\n\nany minimum use or duration required to benefit from promotional terms;\n\n(ii)\n\nany charges related to switching and compensation and refund arrangements for delay or abuse of switching, as well as information about the respective procedures;\n\n(iii)\n\ninformation on the right of consumers using pre-paid services to a refund, upon request, of any remaining credit in the event of switching, as set out in Article 106(6);\n\n(iv)\n\nany fees due on early termination of the contract, including information on unlocking the terminal equipment and any cost recovery with respect to terminal equipment;\n\n(4)\n\nany compensation and refund arrangements, including, where applicable, explicit reference to rights of consumers, which apply if contracted levels of quality of service are not met or if the provider responds inadequately to a security incident, threat or vulnerability;\n\n(5)\n\nthe type of action that might be taken by the provider in reaction to security incidents or threats or vulnerabilities.\n\nB.\n\nInformation requirements for providers of internet access services and publicly available interpersonal communications services\n\nI.\n\nIn addition to the requirements set out in Part A, providers of internet access services and publicly available interpersonal communications services shall provide the following information:\n\n(1)\n\nas part of the main characteristics of each service provided:\n\n(i)\n\nany minimum levels of quality of service to the extent that these are offered, and taking utmost account of the BEREC guidelines adopted in accordance with Article 104(2) regarding:\n\n—\n\nfor internet access services: at least latency, jitter, packet loss,\n\n—\n\nfor publicly available interpersonal communications services, where they exert control over at least some elements of the network or have a service level agreement to that effect with undertakings providing access to the network: at least the time for the initial connection, failure probability, call signalling delays in accordance with Annex X;

with respect to individual categories of services, competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities may require in addition such information to be provided immediately prior to connecting the call or to connecting to the provider of the service;\n\n(v)\n\nfor bundled services and bundles including both services and terminal equipment the price of the individual elements of the bundle to the extent they are also marketed separately;\n\n(vi)\n\ndetails and conditions, including fees, of any after-sales service, maintenance, and customer assistance; and\n\n(vii)\n\nthe means by which up-to-date information on all applicable tariffs and maintenance charges may be obtained;\n\n(3)\n\nas part of the information on the duration of the contract for bundled services and the conditions for renewal and termination of the contract, where applicable, the conditions of termination of the bundle or of elements thereof;\n\n(4)\n\nwithout prejudice to Article 13 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, information on what personal data shall be provided before the performance of the service or collected in the context of the provision of the service;\n\n(5)\n\ndetails on products and services designed for end-users with disabilities and how updates on this information can be obtained;\n\n(6)\n\nthe means of initiating procedures for the resolution of disputes including national and cross-border disputes in accordance with Article 25.\n\nII.\n\nIn addition to the requirements set out in Part A and under Point I, providers of publicly available number-based interpersonal communications services shall also provide the following information:\n\n(1)\n\nany constraints on access to emergency services or caller location information due to a lack of technical feasibility insofar as the service allows end-users to originate calls to a number in a national or international numbering plan;\n\n(2)\n\nthe end-user’s right to determine whether to include his or her personal data in a directory, and the types of data concerned, in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC;\n\nIII.\n\nIn addition to the requirements set out in Part A and under Point I, providers of internet access services shall also provide the information required pursuant to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120.\n\nANNEX IX\n\nINFORMATION TO BE PUBLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 103 (TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION)\n\nThe competent authority in coordination, where relevant, with the national regulatory authority is responsible for ensuring that the information in this Annex is published, in accordance with Article 103. The competent authority in coordination, where relevant, with the national regulatory authority shall decide which information is relevant to be published by the providers of internet access services or publicly available interpersonal communications services, and which information is to be published by the competent authority itself in coordination, where relevant, with the national regulatory authority, in order to ensure that all end-users are able to make informed choices.
