In addition, this Regulation’s goal is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal and technical framework in particular for the development, marketing and use of electronic health record systems (‘EHR systems’) in conformity with Union values. The EHDS will be a key element in the creation of a strong and resilient European Health Union."

      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the imperative of having timely access to quality electronic health data for health threats preparedness and response, as well as for prevention, diagnosis and treatment and for secondary use of such electronic health data. Such timely access could potentially contribute, through efficient public health surveillance and monitoring, to more effective management of future pandemics, to a reduction of costs and to improving the response to health threats, and ultimately could help to save more lives. In 2020, the Commission urgently adapted its Clinical Patient Management System, established by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1269 (4), to allow Member States to share electronic health data of COVID-19 patients moving between healthcare providers and Member States during the peak of that pandemic. However, that adaptation was only an emergency solution, showing the need for a structural and consistent approach at Member State and Union level, both in order to improve the availability of electronic health data for healthcare and to facilitate access to electronic health data in order to steer effective policy responses and contribute to high standards of human health."

It also highlighted the need for sharing electronic health data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (the ‘FAIR principles’), and ensuring that electronic health data are as open as possible, while respecting the data minimisation principle as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Synergies between the EHDS, the European Open Science Cloud and the European Research Infrastructures should be ensured, and lessons should be learned from data-sharing solutions developed under the European COVID-19 Data Platform."

      "text": "More and more individuals living in the Union cross national borders to work, study, visit relatives, or for other reasons. To facilitate the exchange of health data, and in line with the need to empower citizens, they should be able to access their health data in an electronic format that can be recognised and accepted across the Union. Such personal electronic health data could include personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including related to the provision of healthcare services, and which reveal information about that natural person’s health status, personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, as well as data determinants of health, such as behaviour, environmental and physical influences, medical care, and social or educational factors. Electronic health data also include data that have been initially collected for research, statistical, health threat assessment, policymaking or regulatory purposes and it should be possible to make them available in accordance with the rules laid down in this Regulation. Electronic health data consist of all categories of those data, irrespective of whether such data are provided by the data subject or other natural or legal persons, such as health professionals, or are processed in relation to a natural person’s health or well-being and should also include inferred and derived data, such as diagnostics, tests and medical examinations, as well as data observed and recorded by automated means."

      "text": "In health systems, personal electronic health data are usually gathered in electronic health records, which typically contain a natural person’s medical history, diagnoses and treatment, medications, allergies and vaccinations, as well as radiology images, laboratory results and other medical data, spread between different actors in the health system, such as general practitioners, hospitals, pharmacies or care services. In order to allow electronic health data to be accessed, shared and modified by natural persons or health professionals, some Member States have taken the necessary legal and technical measures and set up centralised infrastructures connecting EHR systems used by healthcare providers and natural persons. In addition, some Member States provide support to public and private healthcare providers to set up personal electronic health data spaces to enable interoperability between different healthcare providers. Several Member States also support or provide electronic health data access services for patients and health professionals, for instance through patient or health professional portals. Those Member States have also taken measures to ensure that EHR systems or wellness applications are able to transmit electronic health data to the central EHR system, for instance by providing a system of certification. However, not all Member States have put in place such systems, and those Member States that have implemented them have done so in a fragmented manner. In order to facilitate the free movement of personal electronic health data across the Union and avoid negative consequences for patients when receiving healthcare in a cross-border context, Union action is needed to improve natural persons’ access to their own personal electronic health data and to empower them to share those data. In this respect, appropriate action at Union and national level should be taken as a means of reducing fragmentation, heterogeneity and division, and to create a system that is user-friendly and intuitive in all Member States. Any digital transformation in the healthcare sector should aim to be inclusive and also benefit natural persons with limited ability to access and use digital services, including people with disabilities."

      "text": "Regulation (EU) 2016/679 sets out specific provisions concerning the rights of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data. The EHDS builds upon those rights and complements some of them as applied to personal electronic health data. Those rights apply regardless of the Member State in which the personal electronic health data are processed, type of healthcare provider, sources of those data or Member State of affiliation of the natural person. The rights and rules related to the primary use of personal electronic health data under this Regulation concern all categories of those data, irrespective of how they have been collected or who has provided them, the legal ground for the processing under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or the status of the controller as a public or private organisation. The additional rights of access and portability of personal electronic health data provided for in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the rights of access and portability as established under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Natural persons continue to have those rights under the conditions set out in that Regulation."

      "text": "While the rights conferred by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should continue to apply, the right of access to data by a natural person, established in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should be further complemented in the healthcare sector. Under that Regulation, controllers do not have to provide access immediately. The right of access to health data is still commonly implemented in many places through the provision of the requested health data in paper format or as scanned documents, which is time-consuming for the controller, such as a hospital or other healthcare provider that provides access. That situation slows down access to health data by natural persons, and can have a negative impact on them if they need such access immediately due to urgent circumstances pertaining to their health condition. It is therefore necessary to provide for a more efficient way for natural persons to access their own personal electronic health data. They should have the right to have free-of-charge and immediate access, while respecting the need for technological practicability, to specific priority categories of personal electronic health data, such as the patient summary, through an electronic health data access service. That right should apply regardless of the Member State in which the personal electronic health data are processed, the type of healthcare provider, the sources of those data or the Member State of affiliation of the natural person. The scope of that complementary right established under this Regulation and the conditions for exercising it differ in certain ways from the right of access to personal data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which covers all personal data held by a controller and is exercised against an individual controller, which has up to one month to reply to a request. The right to access personal electronic health data under this Regulation should be limited to the categories of data falling within its scope, be exercised via an electronic health data access service and entail an immediate answer. The rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should continue to apply, allowing natural persons to benefit from their rights under both legal frameworks, in particular the right to obtain a paper copy of the electronic health data."

      "text": "It should be considered that immediate access of natural persons to certain categories of their personal electronic health data could be harmful for the safety of those natural persons or unethical. For example, it could be unethical to inform a patient through an electronic channel about a diagnosis of an incurable disease that is likely to be terminal instead of first providing that information in a consultation with the patient. Therefore, it should be possible to delay the provision of the access to personal electronic health data in such situations for a limited amount of time, for instance until the moment when the health professional can explain the situation to the patient. Member States should be able to establish such an exception where it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society, in line with restrictions as provided for in Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

This could especially be relevant in cases of sensitive health issues such as those related to mental or sexual health, sensitive procedures such as abortions, or data on specific medication which could reveal other sensitive issues. Such selective sharing of personal electronic health data should therefore be supported and implemented through restrictions set by the natural person concerned in the same way within the territory of a given Member State and for cross-border data sharing. Those restrictions should allow for sufficient granularity to restrict parts of datasets, such as elements of the patient summaries. Before setting the restrictions, natural persons should be informed of the risks for patient safety associated with limiting access to health data. Given that the unavailability of the restricted personal electronic health data may impact the provision or quality of health services provided to the natural person, natural persons making use of such access restrictions should assume responsibility for the fact that the healthcare provider cannot take the data into account when providing health services. The restrictions on access to personal electronic health data could have life-threatening consequences and, therefore, access to those data should nevertheless be possible where necessary to protect vital interests in emergency situations.

However, due to a lack of interoperability, in many cases health professionals cannot access the complete medical records of their patients and cannot make optimal medical decisions for their diagnosis and treatment, which adds considerable costs both for health systems and for natural persons and can lead to worse health outcomes for natural persons. Electronic health data made available in an interoperable format and which can be transmitted between healthcare providers can also reduce the administrative burden on health professionals of manually entering or copying health data between electronic systems. Therefore, health professionals should be provided with appropriate electronic means, such as electronic devices and health professional portals or other health professional access services, to use personal electronic health data for the exercise of their duties. As it is difficult to exhaustively determine in advance which data from the existing data in priority categories are medically relevant in a specific episode of care, health professionals should have a wide access to data. When accessing data relating to their patients, health professionals should comply with the applicable law, codes of conduct, deontological guidelines or other provisions governing ethical conduct with respect to sharing or accessing information, particularly in life-threatening or extreme situations. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in order to limit their access to what is relevant in a specific episode of care, healthcare providers should follow the data minimisation principle when accessing personal electronic health data, limiting the data accessed to data that are strictly necessary and justified for a given service. Providing health professional access services is a task assigned in the public interest by this Regulation and the performance of such task requires the processing of personal data as referred to in Article 6(1), point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Different categories have also achieved different levels of maturity as regards standardisation, and therefore the implementation of mechanisms for their exchange may be more or less complex depending on the category. Therefore, the improvement of interoperability and data sharing should be gradual and prioritisation of certain categories of electronic health data is needed. Categories of electronic health data such as patient summaries, electronic prescriptions and dispensations, medical imaging studies and related imaging reports, medical test results such as laboratory results and related reports, and discharge reports have been selected by the eHealth Network as most relevant for the majority of healthcare situations and should be considered as priority categories for Member States to implement access to them and their transmission. Where such priority categories of data represent groups of electronic health data, this Regulation should apply to both the groups as a whole and to the individual data entries included in those groups. For example, given that vaccination status is part of a patient summary, the rights and requirements linked to the patient summary should also apply to such vaccination status even if it is processed separately from the patient summary as a whole. When further needs for the exchange of additional categories of electronic health data are identified for healthcare purposes, access to and exchange of those additional categories should be possible under this Regulation. The additional categories should be first implemented at Member State level and the exchange on a voluntary basis of such categories of data in cross-border situations between the cooperating Member States should be provided for in this Regulation.

For the purpose of processing electronic health data for secondary use, one of the legal bases referred to in Article 6(1), points (a), (c), (e) or (f), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in conjunction with Article 9(2) thereof is required. Accordingly, this Regulation provides for a legal basis for the secondary use of personal electronic health data, including the safeguards required under Article 9(2), points (g) to (j), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to allow the processing of special categories of data, in terms of lawful purposes, trusted governance for providing access to health data through the involvement of health data access bodies, and processing in a secure processing environment, as well as arrangements for data processing, set out in the data permit. Consequently, Member States should no longer be able to maintain or introduce under Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 further conditions, including limitations and specific provisions requesting the consent of natural persons, with regard to the processing for secondary use of personal electronic health data under this Regulation, with the exception of the introduction of stricter measures and additional safeguards at national level aimed at safeguarding the sensitivity and value of certain data as laid down in this Regulation. Health data applicants should also demonstrate a legal basis referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that allows them to request access to electronic health data pursuant to this Regulation and should fulfil the conditions set out in Chapter IV thereof. In addition, the health data access body should assess the information provided by the health data applicant, based on which it should be able to issue a data permit for the processing of personal electronic health data pursuant to this Regulation that should fulfil the requirements and conditions set out in Chapter IV of this Regulation. For processing of electronic health data held by the health data holders, this Regulation creates the legal obligation within the meaning of Article 6(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in accordance with Article 9(2), points (i) and (j), of that Regulation, for the health data holder to make available the personal electronic health data to health data access bodies, while the legal basis for the purpose of the initial processing, for example the delivery of healthcare, is unaffected. This Regulation also assigns tasks in the public interest within the meaning of Article 6(1), point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to the health data access bodies, and meets the requirements of Article 9(2), points (g) to (j), as applicable, of that Regulation. If the health data user relies upon a legal basis set out in Article 6(1), point (e) or (f), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Regulation should provide for the safeguards required under Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

An easily understandable and accessible user-friendly mechanism to exercise that right to opt out should be provided for. Moreover, it is imperative to provide natural persons with sufficient and complete information regarding their right to opt out, including on the benefits and drawbacks entailed by exercising that right.

The categories of electronic health data for secondary use include some categories of data that were initially collected for other purposes such as research, statistics, patient safety, regulatory activities or policymaking, for example, policymaking registries or registries concerning the side effects of medicinal products or medical devices. European databases that facilitate use or reuse of data are available in some areas, such as cancer (the European Cancer Information System) or rare diseases (for example, the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration and European reference networks (ERN) registries).

Even where state-of-the-art anonymisation techniques are used, there remains a residual risk that the capacity to re-identify could be or become available, beyond the means reasonably likely to be used. Such residual risk is present in relation to rare diseases, that is to say a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10 000 persons in the Union, where the limited numbers of cases reduce the possibility of fully aggregating the published data in order to preserve the privacy of natural persons while also maintaining an appropriate level of granularity in order to remain meaningful. Such residual risk can affect different categories of health data and can lead to the re-identification of the data subjects using means that are beyond those reasonably likely to be used. Such risk depends on the level of granularity, on the description of the characteristics of data subjects, on the number of people affected, for instance in cases of data included in electronic health records, disease registries, biobanks and person-generated data, where the range of identification characteristics is broader, and on the possible combination with other information, for example in very small geographical areas, or through the technological evolution of methods which had not been available at the moment of anonymisation. Such re-identification of natural persons would present a major concern and would be likely to put the acceptance of the rules on secondary use provided for in this Regulation at risk. Furthermore, aggregation techniques are less tested for non-personal data containing for example trade secrets, as is the case in the reporting on clinical trials and clinical investigations, and enforcement of breaches of trade secrets outside the Union is more difficult in the absence of a sufficient international protection standard. Therefore, for those categories of health data, there remains a risk of re-identification after the anonymisation or aggregation, which cannot be reasonably mitigated initially. This falls within the criteria indicated in Article 5(13) of Regulation (EU) 2022/868. Those types of health data would thus fall within the empowerment set out in Article 5(13) of that Regulation for transfer to third countries.

Given that, at national level, digital health authorities dealing with primary use may be different from the health data access bodies dealing with secondary use, the functions are different and there is a need for distinct cooperation in each of those areas, the EHDS Board should be able to set up subgroups dealing with those two functions, as well as other subgroups, as needed. In order for there to be an efficient working method, the digital health authorities and health data access bodies should create networks and links at national level with other bodies and authorities, but also at Union level. Such bodies could comprise data protection authorities, cybersecurity, eID and standardisation bodies, as well as bodies and expert groups under Regulations (EU) 2022/868, (EU) 2023/2854 and (EU) 2024/1689 and Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). The EHDS Board should operate independently, in the public interest and in line with its code of conduct."
