They represent a major threat to the functioning of network and information systems. In view of the fast-evolving threat landscape, the threat of possible large-scale cybersecurity incidents causing significant disruption or damage to critical infrastructure demands a heightened preparedness of the Union’s cybersecurity framework. That threat goes beyond Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and is likely to persist given the multiplicity of actors involved in current geopolitical tensions. Such incidents can impede the provision of public services as cyberattacks are frequently targeted at local, regional or national public services and infrastructure, with local authorities being particularly vulnerable, including due to their limited resources. They can also impede the pursuit of economic activities, including in sectors of high criticality or other critical sectors, generate substantial financial losses, undermine user confidence, cause major damage to the economy and the democratic systems of the Union, and could even have health or life-threatening consequences. Moreover, cybersecurity incidents are unpredictable, as they often emerge and evolve quickly, not contained within any specific geographical area, and occurring simultaneously or spreading instantly across many countries. It is important to have close cooperation between the public sector, the private sector, academia, civil society and the media."

Therefore, investment is needed in infrastructure and services and building capabilities to develop cybersecurity skills that will support a faster detection of and a faster response to cyber threats and incidents. In addition, Member States need assistance in better preparing for and responding to, as well as assistance in the initial recovery from, significant cybersecurity incidents and large-scale cybersecurity incidents.

Directive (EU) 2022/2555 also established the CSIRTs network to promote swift and effective operational cooperation among all Member States. To ensure situational awareness and strengthen solidarity, in situations where Cross-Border Cyber Hubs obtain information related to a potential or ongoing large-scale cybersecurity incident, they should provide relevant information to the CSIRTs network and inform, as an early warning, EU-CyCLONe.

The EU Cybersecurity Reserve should ensure the availability and readiness of services. It should therefore include services that are committed in advance, including for instance capacities that are on stand-by and deployable at short notice. The services from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve should serve to support national authorities in providing assistance to affected entities operating in sectors of high criticality or to affected entities operating in other critical sectors as a complement to their own actions at national level. The services from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve should also be able to serve to support Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, under similar conditions. The EU Cybersecurity Reserve could also contribute to strengthening the competitive position of industry and services in the Union across the digital economy, including microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises as well as start-ups, including by providing incentives for investment in research and innovation. It is important to take into account ENISA’s European cybersecurity skills framework when procuring the services for the EU Cybersecurity Reserve. When requesting support from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve, users should include in their application appropriate information regarding the affected entity and potential impact, information about the requested service from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve, and the support provided to the affected entity at the national level, which should be taken into account when assessing the request from the applicant. To ensure complementarity with other forms of support available to the affected entity, the request should also include, where available, information on contractual arrangements in place for incident response and initial recovery services, as well as insurance contracts potentially covering such a type of incident."

DEP-associated third countries should only be eligible to receive support where the agreement through which they are associated to the DEP specifically provides for such support. In addition, such third countries should remain eligible only so long as three criteria are fulfilled. First, the third country should be complying in full with the relevant terms of that agreement. Second, given the complementary nature of the EU Cybersecurity Reserve, the third country should have taken adequate steps to prepare for significant cybersecurity incidents or large-scale-equivalent cybersecurity incidents. Third, the provision of support from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve should be consistent with the Union’s policy towards and overall relations with that country and with other Union policies in the field of security.

The same should apply to renewals and to proposals to amend or repeal such acts. Where, in exceptional circumstances, the Council considers there to have been a significant change of circumstances in respect of the third criterion, the Council should be able to act on its own initiative to amend or repeal an implementing act, without awaiting a Commission proposal. Such significant changes are likely to require urgent action, to have particularly important implications for relations with third countries, and not to require detailed assessment in advance by the Commission. Moreover, the Commission should cooperate with the High Representative in respect of requests for support from DEP-associated third countries and the implementation of support granted to such third countries. The Commission should also take into account any views provided by ENISA in respect of such requests and support.
