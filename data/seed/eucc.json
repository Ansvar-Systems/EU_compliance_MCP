Application notes may give information on how the functional requirements of the Common Criteria as referred to in Article 3 were used to understand the security target;\n\n(g)\n\nthe target of evaluation summary specification shall include all target of evaluation security functions but additional proprietary information may be sanitised;\n\n(h)\n\nreferences to protection profiles applied to the target of evaluation shall be included;\n\n(i)\n\nthe rationale may be sanitised to remove proprietary information.\n\n4.\n\nEven if the sanitised security target is not formally evaluated in accordance with the evaluation standards referred to in Article 3, the certification body shall ensure that it complies with the complete and evaluated security target, and reference both the complete and the sanitised security target in the certification report.\n\nANNEX VI\n\nSCOPE AND TEAM COMPOSITION FOR PEER ASSESSMENTS\n\nVI.1   Scope of the peer assessment\n\n1.\n\nThe following types of peer assessments are covered:\n\n(a)\n\nType 1: when a certification body performs certification activities at the AVA_VAN.3 level;\n\n(b)\n\nType 2: when a certification body performs certification activities related to a technical domain listed as state-of-the-art documents in Annex I;\n\n(c)\n\nType 3: when a certification body performs certification activities above the AVA_VAN.3 level making use of a protection profile listed as state-of-the-art documents in Annex II or III.\n\n2.\n\nThe peer-assessed certification body shall submit the list of certified ICT products that may be candidate to the review by the peer assessment team, in accordance with the following rules:\n\n(a)\n\nthe candidate products shall cover the technical scope of the certification body authorisation, of which at least two different products evaluations at assurance level ‘high’ will be analysed through the peer assessment, and one protection profile if the certification body has issued certificate at assurance level ‘high’;\n\n(b)\n\nfor a Type 2 peer assessment, the certification body shall submit at least one product per technical domain and per concerned ITSEF;\n\n(c)\n\nfor a Type 3 peer assessment, at least one candidate product shall be evaluated in accordance with an applicable and relevant protection profiles.\n\nVI.2   Peer assessment team\n\n1.\n\nThe assessment team shall consist of at least two experts each selected from a different certification body from different Member States that issues certificates at the assurance level ‘high’. The experts should demonstrate the relevant expertise in the standards as referred in Article 3 and state-of-the-art documents that are in scope of the peer assessment.\n\n2.\n\nIn the case of a delegation of certificate issuance or prior approval of certificates as referred to in Article 56(6) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881, an expert from the national cybersecurity certification authority related to the concerned certification body shall in addition participate in the team of experts selected in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Section.\n\n3.\n\nFor a Type 2 peer assessment the team members shall be selected from certification bodies being authorised for the concerned technical domain.\n\n4.\n\nEach member of the assessment team shall have at least two years of experience of carrying out certification activities in a certification body;\n\n5.\n\nFor a Type 2 or 3 peer assessment, each member of the assessment team shall have at least two years of experience of carrying out certification activities in that relevant technical domain or protection profile and proven expertise and participation in the authorisation of an ITSEF\n\n6.\n\nThe national cybersecurity certification authority monitoring and supervising the peer-assessed certification body and at least one national cybersecurity certification authority whose certification body is not subject to the peer assessment shall participate in the peer assessment as an observer. ENISA may also participate in the peer assessment as an observer.\n\n7.\n\nThe peer-assessed certification body is presented with the composition of the peer assessment team. In justified cases, it may challenge the composition of the peer assessment team and ask for its review.\n\nANNEX VII\n\nContent of an EUCC Certificate\n\nAn EUCC certificate shall at least contain:\n\n(a)\n\na unique identifier established by the certification body issuing the certificate;\n\n(b)\n\ninformation related to the certified ICT product or protection profile and the holder of the certificate, including:\n\n(1)\n\nname of the ICT product or protection profile and, where applicable, of the target of evaluation;\n\n(2)\n\ntype of ICT product or protection profile and, where applicable, of the target of evaluation;\n\n(3)\n\nversion of the ICT product or protection profile;\n\n(4)\n\nname, address and contact information of the holder of the certificate;\n\n(5)\n\nlink to the website of the holder of the certificate containing the supplementary cybersecurity information referred to in Article 55 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881;\n\n(c)\n\ninformation related to the evaluation and certification of the ICT product or protection profile, including:\n\n(1)\n\nname, address and contact information of the certification body that issued the certificate;\n\n(2)\n\nwhere different from the certification body, name of the ITSEF which performed the evaluation;\n\n(3)\n\nname of the responsible national cybersecurity certification authority;\n\n(4)\n\na reference to this Regulation;\n\n(5)\n\na reference to the certification report associated with the certificate referred to in Annex V;\n\n(6)\n\nthe applicable assurance level in accordance with Article 4;\n\n(7)\n\na reference to the version of the standards used for the evaluation, referred to in Article 3;\n\n(8)\n\nidentification of the assurance level or package specified in the standards referred to in Article 3 and in conformity with Annex VIII, including the assurance components used and the AVA_VAN level covered;\n\n(9)\n\nwhere applicable, reference to one or more protection profiles with which the ICT product or protection profile complies;\n\n(10)\n\ndate of issuance;\n\n(11)\n\nperiod of validity of the certificate;\n\n(d)\n\nthe mark and label associated with the certificate in accordance with Article 11.\n\nANNEX VIII\n\nAssurance package declaration\n\n1.\n\nContrary to the definitions in the Common Criteria, an augmentation:\n\n(a)\n\nshall not be denoted by the abbreviation ‘+’;\n\n(b)\n\nshall be detailed by a list of all concerned components;\n\n(c)\n\nshall be outlined in detail in the certification report.\n\n2.\n\nThe assurance level confirmed in an EUCC certificate may be complemented by the evaluation assurance level as specified in Article 3 of this Regulation.\n\n3.\n\nIf the assurance level confirmed in an EUCC certificate does not refer to an augmentation, the EUCC certificate shall indicate one of the following packages:\n\n(a)\n\n“the specific assurance package”;\n\n(b)\n\n“the assurance package conformant to a protection profile” in case of referencing a protection profile without an evaluation assurance level.\n\nANNEX IX\n\nMark and label\n\n1.\n\nThe form of mark and label:\n\n2.\n\nIf the mark and label are reduced or enlarged, the proportions given in the drawing above shall be respected.\n\n3.\n\nWhere physically present, the mark and label shall be at least 5 mm high.\n\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/482/oj\n\nISSN 1977-0677 (electronic edition)\n\n////////////////////////$(document).ready(function(){generateTOC(true,'', 'Top','false');scrollToCurrentUrlAnchor();});",
