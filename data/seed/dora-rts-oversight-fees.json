Where the period of the oversight activities of such critical ICT third-party service provider does not correspond to a full year, that oversight fee shall be equal to the amount paid by each ICT third-party service provider under paragraph 1, multiplied by the number of calendar days from the designation of the ICT third-party service provider as critical until the end of that year and divided by the total number of days in that year.\n\n3.   Where an ICT third-party service provider requests to be designated as critical in accordance with Article 31(11) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, it shall pay a fixed opt-in fee of EUR 50 000.
