Those policies and procedures should also ensure the optimisation of ICT systems’ operation and that the ICT systems’ and capacity’s performance meets the established business and information security objectives (capacity and performance management). Lastly, those policies and procedures should ensure the effective and smooth day-to-day management and operation of ICT systems (ICT operations), thereby minimising the risk of loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should therefore identify and implement such controls on the basis of a risk-based approach. To that end, financial entities should encrypt the data concerned at rest, in transit or, where necessary, in use, on the basis of the results of a two-pronged process, namely data classification and a comprehensive ICT risk assessment. Given the complexity of encrypting data in use, financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should encrypt date in use only where that would be appropriate in light of the results of the ICT risk assessment. Financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should, however, be able, where encryption of data in use is not feasible or is too complex, to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data concerned through other ICT security measures. Given the rapid technological developments in the field of cryptographic techniques, financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should remain abreast of relevant developments in cryptanalysis and consider leading practices and standards. Financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should hence follow a flexible approach, based on risk mitigation and monitoring, to deal with the dynamic landscape of cryptographic threats, including threats from quantum advancements."

That separation should serve as an important ICT security measure against unintended and unauthorised access to, modifications of, and deletions of data in the production environment, which could result in major disruptions in the business operations of financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation. However, considering current ICT system development practices, in exceptional circumstances, financial entities should be allowed to test in production environments, provided that they justify such testing and obtain the required approval."

Financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should therefore identify and remedy vulnerabilities in their ICT environment, and both the financial entities and their ICT third-party service providers should adhere to a coherent, transparent, and responsible vulnerability management framework. For the same reason, financial entities should monitor ICT vulnerabilities using reliable resources and automated tools, verifying that ICT third-party service providers ensure prompt action on vulnerabilities in provided ICT services."

While the use of generic or shared accounts should exceptionally be permitted under circumstances specified by financial entities, financial entities should ensure that the accountability for actions taken through those accounts is maintained.

In the context of those policies and procedures, financial entities should adopt testing practices and methods that suit their needs, while adhering to a risk-based approach and ensuring that a secure, reliable, and resilient ICT environment is maintained. To guarantee the secure implementation of an ICT project, financial entities should ensure that staff from specific business sectors or roles influenced or impacted by that ICT project can provide the necessary information and expertise. To ensure effective oversight, reports on ICT projects, in particular about projects that affect critical or important functions and about their associated risks, should be submitted to the management body. Financial entities should tailor the frequency and details of the systematic and ongoing reviews and reports to the importance and the size of the ICT projects concerned."

To assess the integrity of the software and to ensure that the use of that software does not pose ICT security risks, financial entities should also review source codes of software acquired, including, where feasible, of proprietary software provided by ICT third-party service providers, using both static and dynamic testing methods."

To safeguard financial entities from potential ICT vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could expose them to significant risks, a rigorous verification process is necessary to confirm that all changes meet the necessary ICT security requirements. Financial entities referred to in Title II of this Regulation should therefore, as an essential element of their ICT security policies and procedures, have in place sound ICT change management policies and procedures. To uphold the objectivity and effectiveness of the ICT change management process, to prevent conflicts of interest, and to ensure that ICT changes are evaluated objectively, it is necessary to separate the functions responsible for approving those changes from the functions that request and implement those changes. To achieve effective transitions, controlled ICT change implementation, and minimal disruptions to the operation of the ICT systems, financial entities should assign clear roles and responsibilities that ensure that ICT changes are planned, adequately tested, and that quality is ensured. To ensure that ICT systems continue to operate effectively, and to provide a safety net for financial entities, financial entities should also develop and implement fall-back procedures. Financial entities should clearly identify those fall-back procedures and assign responsibilities to ensure a swift and effective response in the event of unsuccessful ICT changes."
