The fundamental steps on which a specific involvement of the TLPT authority is necessary include the validation of certain fundamental documentation of the testing, and the selection of threat intelligence providers and testers and risk management measures. The involvement of the TLPT authorities, and in particular for validations, should not result in an excessive burden for those authorities and should therefore be limited to those documentation and decisions that directly affect the conduct of the TLPT.

Should staff members responsible for the security of the financial team be aware of a planned or ongoing TLPT, it is likely that they would be more observant and alert than during normal working conditions, thereby resulting in an altered outcome of the testing. Staff members of the financial entity outside of the control team should therefore only be made aware of any planned or ongoing TLPT where there are cogent reasons and subject to the prior agreement of the test managers, inter alia to ensure the secrecy of the test in case a blue team member has detected the testing."

For the same reason, members of the control team should have a deep knowledge of the financial entity, of the control team lead’s job role and strategic positioning, should have the required seniority and should have access to the management board.

Those risks highlight the need for robust risk management measures. To ensure that the TLPT is conducted in a controlled manner all along the testing, it is very important that financial entities are at all points aware of the particular risks that arise in a TLPT and that those risk are mitigated. In that respect, without prejudice to the internal processes of the financial entity and the responsibility and delegations already provided to the control team lead, information about the TLPT risk management measures, or, in particular cases the approval of those risk management measures by the financial entity’s management body itself, may be appropriate. To be able to deliver effective and most qualified professional services and to reduce those risks, it is also essential that the testers and threat intelligence providers (together, the TLPT providers) have the highest level of skills, expertise, and an appropriate experience in threat intelligence and TLPT in the financial services industry."
