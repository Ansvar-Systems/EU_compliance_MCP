## Why This Exists

EU compliance is scattered across EUR-Lex PDFs, official journals, and regulatory sites. Whether you're:
- A **developer** implementing GDPR data rights or NIS2 incident reporting
- A **product team** navigating AI Act risk assessments or Medical Device conformity
- A **compliance officer** mapping ISO 27001 to DORA requirements
- A **legal researcher** comparing PSD2 authentication vs. eIDAS trust services

...you shouldn't need a law degree and 47 browser tabs. Ask Claude. Get the exact article. With context.

This MCP server makes EU regulations **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

## Why Not Just Use EUR-Lex?

EUR-Lex is authoritative. It's also **designed for lawyers, not developers**.

| EUR-Lex | This MCP Server |
|---------|-----------------|
| Search by CELEX number | Search by plain English: *"incident reporting timeline"* |
| Navigate 100+ page PDFs | Get the exact article with context |
| Manual cross-referencing | `compare_requirements` tool does it instantly |
| "Which regulations apply to me?" → research for days | `check_applicability` tool → answer in seconds |
| Copy-paste article text | Article + definitions + related requirements |
| Check 37 sites for updates | Daily automated freshness checks |
| No API, no integration | MCP protocol → AI-native |

**Example:**
- EUR-Lex: Download DORA PDF → Ctrl+F "incident" → Read Article 17 → Google "What's a major incident?" → Cross-reference NIS2 → Repeat for 5 regulations
- This MCP: *"Compare incident reporting requirements across DORA, NIS2, and CRA"* → Done.

This isn't replacing EUR-Lex. It's making it **usable in 2026**.

## Data Sources

All content is sourced from official public sources:

- **[EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/)** — Official EU law portal (CC BY 4.0)
- **[UNECE](https://unece.org/)** — UN Economic Commission for Europe (UN R155, R156)
- **[ENISA](https://enisa.europa.eu/)** — EU Agency for Cybersecurity guidance

No copyrighted ISO standards are included. For ISO 27001 full text, you'll need to purchase licenses from ISO.

---

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/EU_compliance_MCP
cd eu-regulations-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run in development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Adding New Regulations

Adding a regulation is a single command — it's automatically monitored for updates:

```bash
# Ingest an EU regulation from EUR-Lex
npx tsx scripts/ingest-eurlex.ts 32024R1183 data/seed/eidas2.json
npm run build:db

# That's it. The regulation is now:
# - In the database
# - Automatically monitored by daily EUR-Lex checker
# - Included in auto-update workflow
```

### Freshness Monitoring

A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily at 6 AM UTC to ensure regulations stay current:

- **Checks EUR-Lex RSS feeds** for recent legislative changes
- **Compares versions** against local database
- **Creates GitHub issues** when updates are available
- **Auto-closes issues** when regulations are current

To manually check for updates:

```bash
npm run check-updates
```

To trigger auto-update (re-ingest all + publish):
1. Go to Actions → Daily EUR-Lex Update Check
2. Run workflow with `auto_update: true`

### Webhook Notifications

Get instant alerts when EUR-Lex updates are detected. All webhooks are optional — the workflow continues to work with GitHub issues if no secrets are configured.

**Slack Setup:**
1. Create an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in your Slack workspace
2. Add secret `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. The workflow will post formatted notifications with links to the issue and workflow run

**Discord Setup:**
1. Create a webhook in your Discord server settings (Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks)
2. Add secret `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in repository settings
3. Optional: Add `DISCORD_MENTION_ROLE_ID` to mention a specific role (get role ID from Discord developer mode)

**Generic Webhook (Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, etc.):**
Add `GENERIC_WEBHOOK_URL` secret to receive JSON payloads:

```json
{
  "event": "regulation_update_detected",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-27T06:00:00Z",
  "repository": "owner/repo",
  "run_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/123",
  "issue_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/45",
  "summary": {
    "total_monitored": 37,
    "updates_found": 3,
    "details": "..."
  }
}
```

All webhook notifications use `continue-on-error: true`, so failures won't break the workflow.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Legal Advice

> **🚨 THIS TOOL IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE 🚨**
>
> Regulation text is sourced verbatim from EUR-Lex and UNECE (official public sources). However:
> - **Control mappings** (ISO 27001, NIST CSF) are interpretive aids, not official guidance
> - **Applicability rules** are generalizations, not legal determinations
> - **Cross-references** are research helpers, not compliance mandates
>
> **Always verify against official sources and consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions.**

### Token Usage

> **⚠️ Context Window Warning**
>
> Some articles are very large (e.g., MDR Article 123 = ~70,000 tokens). The MCP server:
> - **Search tool**: Returns smart snippets (safe for context)
> - **Get article tool**: Returns full text (may consume significant tokens)
> - **Recommendation**: Use search first, then fetch specific articles as needed
>
> Claude Desktop has a 200k token context window. Monitor your usage when retrieving multiple large articles.

### ISO Standards Copyright

**No copyrighted ISO standards are included.** Control mappings reference ISO 27001:2022 control IDs only (e.g., "A.5.1", "A.8.2"). The actual text of ISO standards requires a paid license from ISO. This tool helps map regulations to controls but doesn't replace the standard itself.

## About Ansvar Systems

We build AI-accelerated threat modeling and compliance tools for automotive, financial services, and healthcare. This MCP server started as our internal reference tool — turns out everyone building for EU markets has the same EUR-Lex frustrations.

So we're open-sourcing it. Navigating 37 regulations shouldn't require a legal team.

**[ansvar.ai](https://ansvar.ai)** — Stockholm, Sweden

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database Not Found Error

If you see `Failed to open database at .../data/regulations.db`:

The database is built automatically during installation via the `postinstall` script. If it's missing:

```bash
# Rebuild the database
npm run build:db

# Or if installed globally/via npx, reinstall
npm install -g @ansvar/eu-regulations-mcp --force
```

The database contains all 37 regulations (~15MB). It's gitignored in the source repo but built during:
- `npm install` (postinstall hook)
- `npm publish` (prepublishOnly hook)

### MCP Server Not Starting

Check that you're using Node.js 18 or higher:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
```

### Slow First Query

The first query after startup may be slow (~1-2s) as SQLite loads the database into memory. Subsequent queries are fast (<50ms).
